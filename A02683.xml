         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Wherefore the Ieſuite may take from mee, thus cleared, this falſity vnto himſelfe: or elſe hee muſt returne it ouer; To the Authoritie of their Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Church; To their authentike and ordinary gloſſes and explanations of the Goſpell; To the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Romane Biſhops; To their chiefeſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſts and Diuines: for in the writings of all thoſe, he may finde ſentences written in that Worke, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Imperfect Worke,</hi> alleaged as out of <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom.</hi>

               <p>Were this Ieſuite in our Vniuerſitie Schooles, he wold be hiſt out, as an abſurd Dunſe, for arguing.

               <p>But if the Ieſuite will rightly aſſume out of the Maior propoſition, ſet down in the ſaid Canon law; he muſt take the triple crowne of <hi>Primacy</hi> from the Popes head, and wrap it vp in the duſt of <hi>Confuſion,</hi> thus:</p>

The Lorde brings in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene worldly, or temporall Princes, and Eccleſiaſticalls: becauſe the Princes of the vvorld are therefore made, that they might rule ouer their ſubiects, and ſerue themſelues of them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 9 ver. 11. &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſpoyle them to their owne profit and glory</hi> (according to the ſaying of God to <hi>Samuel;</hi> 
                  <q>This ſhall be the manner of your King: hee will take your ſonnes for his Chariot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driuers, Captaines, and Husbandmen; and your Daughters for Apothecaries, Cookes, and Bakers:

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Princes Eccleſiaſticall are therefore made, that they may ſerue their vnderlings, and miniſter vnto them all things which they haue receiued from Christ: That they ſhould neglect their owne profit, and procure the profit of others: and if neede be, that they ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to die, for the ſafety or ſaluation</hi> (pro ſalute) <hi>of their inferiours. Therefore if theſe things be ſo, there is cauſe and profit to deſire the Secular Primacy; but to deſire the Eccleſiacticall, there is neither reaſon nor cauſe. For what wiſe man would hasten vvillingly to ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to ſeruitude, labour, griefe, and ſuch a danger, as to render an account for all the Church, before the inst Iudge? vnleſſe peraduenture, he thinke there is no iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, or feares it not: as one, abuſing his Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall Primacy ſecularly, changeth the Eccleſiasticall into the Secular.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Than which words, what could be written more diſtinctly and plainely, againſt this lying Ieſuite, and his Popes Primacy; to ſtop the mouth of the one, and to plucke vp the other by the rootes? I meane the <hi>Primacy Papall,</hi> which is now become the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt temporall Primacy in the earth: of which, the Emperours, as vaſſals, holde their Imperiall crowns, yea their liues; and yet neither of theſe, but during the Popes pleaſure. And this is with them become an article of the Romiſh faith. Hence it is, that his Maieſties ſubiects are forbidden by the Pope, in their oath of Allegiance, to ſweare, that, what in them lieth, they will preſerue the life of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19639:12"/>againſt the Papall, and all other forrain pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; becauſe (as the Pope hath definitiuely ſet it down) they ſhould therein deny the faith. Is not this his <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Primacy</hi> become <hi>Temporall,</hi> or rather Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall? Therefore euery good Chriſtian, from <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſostome</hi> here is to learne, That the Pope either thinketh there is <hi>no God,</hi> or <hi>Iudgement of God to come;</hi> or that the feare of God, and of his Iudgement, is not before his eyes. Surely, if the popiſh Primacy be that Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, here deſcribed by <hi>Chryſoſtome;</hi> the Pope will no longer contend for it; he will ſoon hate it worſe than dogge or ſnake.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Ieſuite here either very ignorantly, or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry impudently abuſeth his Reader; whom hee would make belieue that <hi>Chryſostome</hi> in that Homily, ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth the Primacy of Honour, to witte Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical, from the obtaining of that Primacy; as though he miſliked the one for vanitie, and approued the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a good thing giuen by God: whereas the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words of <hi>Chryſostome</hi> are cleane contrary; thus: <hi>Nune ſcimus, &amp;c. Now vve knowe that a good vvorke is one thing, and the Primacy of honour is another thing; And that it is good to deſire a good thing: but to couet the Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of honour, is vanitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſhut vp this point; The Chriſtian Reader may here vnderſtand, that the Pope euen by the vertue of this teſtimony of <hi>Chryſostome,</hi> ſet down in, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by, the Canon law, is incapable of Eccleſiaſticall Primacy. For if he be no Prieſt indeede, he can be no Eccleſiaſticall Primate indeede. But by this Canon indeede he is no Prieſt, becauſe he is no Prieſt <hi>Opere,</hi> in <hi>Prieſtly work,</hi> that is, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> expounds it, <hi>to preach the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19639:13"/>vvord in ſeaſon,</hi>

Here is now high time for this Ieſuite to lay-vnder his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for ſupport of the tottering Primacy of his Pope, very ſore ſhaken by this Canon law-ſhot, and ready to fall down into the duſt.

Tranſtulit,</hi> writeth thus: <hi>The Pope may, vpon very great cauſe, transferre the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire from one nation to another, becauſe he can doe vvhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer God can doe; otherwiſe Chriſt had not beene ſo dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent a father of his family, if he had not leſt one on earth in his place, vvho can doe all things that Christ himſelfe can doe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this it is plaine, that as <hi>All power in heauen and earth was giuen to Chriſt: So all power in heauen &amp; earth, is giuen to the Pope.</hi> And conſequently, it is as plaine, that as <hi>Chriſt is God:</hi> ſo <hi>the Pope is God.</hi> For better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of which conſequent; I ſend the Ieſuite to that learned and iudicious, yet popiſh, Writer, <hi>Marſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Patauinus,</hi> who relateth out of <hi>Bernard</hi> thus: <hi>All things were giuen to Christ, becauſe he was the eternall Sonne of God. And Christ doth challenge to himſelfe all things, by the right of creation, and merit of redemption. And vvhoſoeuer takes theſe vnto himſelfe, makes himſelfe indeede God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2.4</note> That is (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribeth him) the popiſh <hi>Antichriſt, ſitting in the temple of God as God, ſhewing himſelfe that he is God;</hi> or rather, <hi>exalting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19639:16"/>aboue all that is called God, or worſhipped.</hi> Which may better appeare by <hi>Becanes</hi> ſolution of theſe two Queſtions following: Firſt, whether, as to Chriſt and Pope, <hi>All power is giuen in heauen and earth;</hi> ſo both Chriſt and Pope, haue one and the ſame name giuen to them, <hi>viz. The name aboue euery name; that at the name of the Pope,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 1.9.</note> 
                  <hi>as at the name of leſus, euery knee ſhould bow of things in heauen, in earth, and vnder the earth?</hi> Vnto this former queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I ſuppoſe <hi>Becane</hi> would ſay, <hi>Reſpondetur quod ſic,</hi> that is, affirmatiuely: becauſe in his <hi>Examen,</hi> pag. 133. he ſaith, <hi>The Pope Peter was receiued into the fellowſhip of the name and dignity of the indiuiduall vnity, or Godhead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the ſecond queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> goes further, thus: <hi>whether at the name,</hi> yea at the <hi>feete,</hi> of the Pope, all ſhould not doe more, than bow the knee; ſince the greateſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours muſt fall downe flatte with their faces on the ground, to kiſſe his feete; and with their necks ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out, muſt receiue and entertaine his feete tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon them; and laſtly (as it is challenged at this time) muſt offer readily their throats to be cut at the Popes pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Before I leaue this Straine, I muſt ſet downe that which the <hi>Gloſſe,</hi> out of the foreſaide Canon <hi>Omnes. D.</hi> 22. inferreth, <hi>viz.</hi> thus: <hi>Argumentum quod Papa habet vlrum<expan>

                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:19639:16"/>whereof we heard before out of <hi>Chryſoſtome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here two great miſchiefes are neceſſarily inferred, pat vpon the Popes head: the former; <hi>That he is that Antichriſt, and his Primacy Antichriſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The later; <hi>That the Pope, by reaſon of that his Primacy, lieth deepely plunged into helliſh confuſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet here the Ieſuite <hi>Becane</hi> is as mute as a fiſh: ſo miſerable a deſendour of the Pope is he; even that <hi>Becane,</hi> who in the Preface to his <hi>Examen</hi> wiſhed, that he might be the kings valiant <hi>Champion</hi> to deſend his Cauſe.

He pretermitted nothing vvhich either fraudor ambition could compaſſe. Hee vvas ſo proud, that hee contemned all men. There are ſome vvho vvrite, that hee ſuborned, and priuily ſent certaine men, vvho in the night by a voyce ſent downe as it vvere from heauen, entering the Chamber of Pope Caelestine (a ſimple man) ſhould perſwade him to relinquiſh his Popedome, if hee vvould be ſaued. This is notorious, that vvhen <hi>Prochetes</hi> the Archbiſhop of Geneua, vvas before him on his knees vpon Aſhwedneſday, vvhereas, according to the manner, the Pope ſhould throwe aſhes vpon his head &amp; ſay: Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber man thou art but aſhes, and to aſhes thou ſhalt returne; <hi>Boniface</hi> cast aſhes into <hi>Prochetes</hi> eyes, and ſaid: Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber man thou art a Gibelline, and vvith the Gibellines, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes thou ſhalt returne. The ſame <hi>Boniface</hi> ſent his letter to <hi>Philip</hi> King of France, firſt to exhort him, and if that vvould not ſerue, to threaten him to undertake the Hiern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem expedition. <hi>Philip</hi> commits that Legate to priſon; vvhereupon the Pope ſends the Archdeacon of Marbon,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19639:18"/>to command the King in the Popes name to diſmiſſe his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat; and if he refuſed, to tell him in the hearing of all men, That becauſe of his contumacy and violating the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, The kingdo<hi rend="sup">•</hi> of France was deuolued to the Church of Rome.

               <p>If euer there were, or be, an ignorant ſlug, trifling lie friuolous, boyiſh lie ſcurrilous, &amp; a lying, forſooth, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ieſuite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this <hi>Becane</hi> is one, &amp; among ſuch may bear the bell: as I wil make it appeare before I diſmiſſe him.</p>
               <p>His boyiſh ſcurrilities are two: In the former, hee asketh whether <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Page,</hi> be all one with mee? A queſtion fitter to be made by a <hi>Petite</hi> ſchool-boy to his fellow, then by a Father, Ieſuite, to an ancient Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine. In the ſecond, hee would cut-off all my hope to attaine the degree of Batchelour. The Ieſuite may knowe that I am a Doctour in Diuinity, of 19. yeares ſtanding; it may bee, as ancient Doctour as himſelfe. Howſoeuer that; I dare boldly auerre this; that <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane,</hi> in compariſon of Doctour <hi>Harris,</hi> is (in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) but an Abecedary ſcholler in the varietie of all good literature diuine and humane; in all the liberall ſciences; and in all the learned tongues: as he ſhal find, to his ſhame, if therein hee dare grapple with mee. I muſt confeſſe, and ſay with Saint <hi>Paul, I vvas a foole to boaſt my ſelfe.</hi> But the ſcurrilous diſgracings of this ſeelie Ieſuite haue enforced mee.</p>
               <p>As his ſcurrilities, ſo his lies are alſo two: The former, That I cited out of the Chapter <hi>Cuminter non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nullos,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19639:20"/>Pag.</hi> 22. whereas in my paper book, it was cited thus in ſhort: <hi>Extrauag.</hi> 22. <hi>ca.

As though ſuch ouerſights in printing, are not vſuall? This Ieſuite himſelfe, <hi>Exam. pag.</hi> 98. will haue, an eſcape of farre greater moment to paſſe in the printed books of <hi>Tertullian</hi> againſt <hi>Praxeas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His ſecond vntruth is; That I cited it ſo falſly, not of ouerſight, but of meere ignorance, and dulneſſe. Alas for this feely ignorant, and (here) impudently lying Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite! vnto whom, vpon pawne of all my books, I will vndertake and performe it, to read Lectures out of the Canon law; in the ſtudie whereof I haue ſpent more weeks, yea moneths, then this Ieſuite hath beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed houres.</p>

               <p>The truth is, that place, viz. <hi>Extrauag. Ioan.</hi> 22. <hi>cap. Inter nonnullos</hi> in <hi>gloſs.</hi> was cited by mee, to ſhew, that Kings receiue their power, non ſimply, of the Pope; but more then ſo, viz. of the Romiſh Biſhop, as of <hi>Their Lord God the Pope.</hi>

               <p>IHaue read that Canon ouer diligently, more often then <hi>Becan</hi> hath fingers on both his hands; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I find, that if vnrepentant fornicators, Prieſts or Deacons, forbidden entrance into the Church, wil yet preſume to vſe their Miniſtery in the Church, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are inhibited to heare them.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:19639:35"/>
               <p>And, whoſoeuer will not obey that precept, incurres the ſinne of Idolatry, according to that of <hi>Samuell; It is the ſinne of vvitcheraſt not to obey, and the vvickednes of Idolatry not to listen, or aſſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So farre reacheth that rule particular. Then follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in that Canon, the generall rule, in theſe vvords: <hi>Peccatumigitur Paganitat is incurrit, &amp;c. Therefore, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſaith hee is a Chriſtian, and contemneth to obey the Sea Apoſtolicall, incurreth the ſinne of Paganiſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that by this Canon, what Chriſtian ſoeuer diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunding any thing (good or euill, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath it) <hi>incurres the ſinne of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganity;</hi> he muſt be reputed an heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If the Ieſuit knew not, that the Canon riſeth <hi>ab Hypotheſi ad theſin,</hi> from the particular to the generall, he ſhewed himſelfe to be a very vnlearned man: if he knew it, in writing thus, he ſheweth himſelfe to be a braſen-fac't abuſer of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>That the Reader may ſee the truth of this generality (a matter ſo neerly concerning the crownes and liues of Princes) I wil produce, for proofe thereof, two other places of the Canon law, wherin that foreſaid generall rule is thus ſet down. The former, <hi>Clementis de haereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis. ca. Adnoſtrum. in Gloſſa. Peccatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; paganitatis incurrit, quicum Chriſtianu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;ſe aſſerat, ſedi Apoſtolicae obedire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnit.

               </p>
               <p>Where that Gloſſe, to proue that generall, citeth <hi>Diſt.</hi> 10. <hi>ca. Nulli fas. Nulli fas est, velle, velpoſſe, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredi Apoſtolicae ſedis praecepta.

               <p>The ſecond place is, <hi>Extrauag. Ioan.</hi> 22. <hi>de verborum ſignifica. cap. Cuminter nonnullos, in Gloſſ.

               <p>
                  <hi>Hee is an Heretick, who with a proud mind, contemneth to keepe, and obey, the diſpoſition or order of the Apostolike Sea, not infringing the Articles of faith: ſith it is the ſin of witchcraft not to obey; and the wickednes of Idolatry, not to harken; and the voice of Paganiſme, to contemne to obey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, by the expreſſe words of the Canon, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of this is apparant, viz. <hi>To diſobey the Sea of Rome, commaunding any thing which is not hereticall,</hi> (for in matter of manners, ſaith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> the Pope can not erre.) <hi>is withchraft, Idolatry, Hereſie.</hi> Therefore, if the Pope ſhould commaund a Ieſuit, or the vileſt ſlaue in a kingdome, to kill the King, who retaineth his crowne after the Pope hath excommunicated him, &amp; depriued him of his crowne: <hi>it is vvitchcraft, idolatry, and hereſie, in that ieſuit or ſlaue, who vvilfully refuſeth to kill that King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Myſterie</hi> of <hi>Antichristian iniquitie,</hi> as it is now reuealed, proceedeth yet further, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the lawfull kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Kings, by the vileſt vaſſall, without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of the Pope, or of any Superior, not onely after ſuch a King be ſolemnly depriued of his dominions by the Pope, but without that, after ſentence declaratorie only pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced; to weet, of hereſie, or any other crime of that King, containing the penalty of depriuation.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19639:36"/>For that is now an orthodoxall poſition of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colike Romiſh faith, Printed <hi>Cum priuilegio,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely maintained by <hi>Suarius</hi> in his booke, with this Title, <hi>The defence of the Catholike faith, againſt the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Engliſh ſect, vvith the anſwere to the Apologie of the oath of Fidelity, and the Preface monitory to the king, &amp;c.</hi> The words of <hi>Suarius</hi> containing that Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian iniquitie, Impietie, Impudency; are theſe: <hi>It is most true,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 6. cap. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>that the Pope may inflict the penalty of Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and pronounce the ſentence of Depriuation of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of any King ſupreme in his temporals: after vvhich iuſt ſentence ſo pronounced, vvhereby,</hi> ipſo facto, <hi>hee is depoſed of his kingdome; If a priuate man ſhall kill the king, he doth it not by priuate authority, but in the vertue of the ſentence, and conſequently, as an inſtrument of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie publike. When a king is depoſed, then he is no king, nor lawfull Prince. Yea, if ſuch a king, after, Lawfull depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of him, perſiſting obſtinate, doth vvithholde his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by force, in this he begins to be a tyrant, becauſe hee is no lawfull king, neither by any iuſt title doth poſſeſſe his kingdome. This more plainely appeareth in a king that is an Heretike: for by his hereſie, forſooth,</hi> ipſo facto, <hi>hee is depriued in ſome ſort, of his Dominion, and the proprietie of his kingdome: becauſe it either remaineth confiſcate, or euen by the very law is deuolued to his Succeſſour, if he be a Catholike. And yet neuertheleſſe, he may not preſently be depriued of his kingdome, but doth poſſeſſe, and adminiſter the ſame iuſtly, vntill by ſentence, at least declaratory, hee be iustly condemned of his crime. But after that ſentence giuen he is altogether depriued of his kingdome, ſo that hee can not with iust title poſſeſſe the ſame. Therefore from that time, hee may be handled altogether as a tyrant, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:19639:37"/>conſequently may be ſlaine by any priuate man vvhatſoeuer. Now in the last point propoſed, this is to be ſaide. That af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſentence condemnatory of the king (for the priuation of his kingdom) giuen by the Pope, or, vvhich is all one, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſentence declaratory of a crime, hauing ſuch a penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by the law impoſed on that crime; certainely hee vvhich gaue ſentence, or to vvhom he committed it, may depriue the king of his kingdome, euen by killing him; either if hee can not otherwiſe depriue him, or if the iust ſentence extend to the depriuing of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Marke well, ô yee Chriſtian Princes, eſpecially ô yee Princes Proteſtant orthodoxall: doe you behold (for it more neerely concerneth every one of you) into what, even the higheſt, pitch of traiterous impudency and impietie, this <hi>Coccatrice broode,</hi> and <hi>Generation of vipers,</hi> to witte, the Ieſuites, are mounted? when as in their treaſonfull dogmaticall poſitions, publiſhed in print to all the world, and moſt ſtiffely by them auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as doctrines of Catholike faith, they teach it to be lawfull for any, the baſeſt villaine of a king to kill the king, being excommunicated, depoſed, or otherwiſe declared to be ſo and ſo criminous.

               <p>The time was, when Emperours were the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Lords of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19639:38"/>or forbid vertue; the Church ſhould belieue vice to be good, and vertue to be euill:</hi> but <hi>Becane</hi> brings him in writing more impudently, and blaſphemouſly, thus: <hi>If the Pope ſhould erre in commanding vices, or forbidding ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, the Church vvere bound to beleeue vices to be good, and vertues to be euill, vnleſſe the Church would ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her conſcience.</hi> Which is plaine blaſphemie, and for which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> incurreth S. <hi>Pauls</hi> curſe directlie, For hee can not deny, but that the bleſſed Angels of heauen, and Apoſtles, were as free from errour, in their Angelicall and Apoſtolicall doctrines of faith, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as the Pope is: yet ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 1. verſ. 8: <hi>If vve, or an Angell from heauen, ſhould preach vnto you otherwiſe, than that yee haue receiued, let him be accurſed.</hi> But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thus: If the Pope ſhould preach other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, viz. <hi>vertue to be euill, and vice good</hi> (according to that of <hi>Eſay,</hi> Chap. 5. verſ. 20. <hi>Woe be to them, that ſpeak good of euill, and euill of good</hi>) the Church ought to hold the Pope ſo bleſſed, as that ſhe ſhould ſinne, if ſhee did not belieue him ſo erring, and erroneouſly preaching; What is this elſe, but to giue the holy Spirit of God, the Lie in his face?</p>

               </p>
               <p>Further, it is apparantly vntrue (wherewith <hi>Becane</hi> doth heere charge mee) viz. that I ſaid, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> did abſolutely affirme the Pope to command vice and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19639:39"/>vertue: or that the Church ſhould belieue vice to be good, and vertue euill: for I cited it in a hypotheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call or conditional propoſition, thus: <hi>If the Pope ſhould command vice, &amp;c.</hi> and not by a categoricall, or ſinglie affirmatiue propoſition, thus: <hi>The Pope doth command vice, and forbid vertue, &amp;c.</hi> It may be, <hi>Becanes</hi> learning extendeth not ſo farre, as to knowe when a thing is vttered categorically, and when hypothetically; and ſo of ignorant ſimplicitie, he falſely burdened me with it. If it were ſo, I will the rather forgiue him; but then I would haue him to goe to ſchoole againe, to learne the principles of Logike: if he knew it, and yet would write thus, he abuſeth his Reader not a little.</p>
               <p>But I will leaue this vnlearned Ieſuite a while; and indeede I begin to growe very weary of him: with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> here would I gladly change a few wordes; and learne of him, whether the Church bee bound in any caſe, to beleeue errour in faith, or in the neceſſary precepts of manners? If he affirme it, he ſhewes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be an Heretike <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, condemned in his owne conſcience: if hee deny it, then ſuppoſe the Pope ſhould erre in faith or manners, yet the Church ſhould not belieue him therin. By the rules of the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> law, <hi>If the Pope erre in faith, that is, if he be an Heretike, he ſhould be depoſed:</hi> but by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> paralell, <hi>If the Pope erre in faith, he must be beleeued.</hi> If this be not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine hereticall, what can be hereticall? Therefore to the euerlaſting ſhame of Ieſuites, let this hereticall poſition of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> (which <hi>Becane</hi> ſeekes heere to defend, but the very heathen would bluſh to aſſert of any) bee ingrauen with a penne of yron in lead or ſtone for euer; viz. <hi>If the Pope ſhould erre in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19639:39"/>vices, and forbidding vertues, the Church is bound in conſcience, to belieue vices to be good, and vertues to be euill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Goe to now ô Pope, and ſay, <hi>Soule thou hast enough:</hi> for now, doe but command the bloudy and traiterous crime of Regicide, that is, killing of kings, as a vertue, it is preſently good; and the Church is bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to beleeue it to be good. The like is to be ſaid of Adulterie, Inceſt, Idolatrie, Blaſphemy. VVhat needes now the Pope to diſpence with theſe ſinnes, ſeeing that by his commanding of them to be done, he makes them euen vertues?</p>
               <p>That which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirmeth here to bee an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurditie and imposſibilitie; their great learned VVri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Schoolemen, and Canoniſts (as, <hi>Ockam, Cuſan, Antonin. Sanders, Turrecremata, Zabarella, Canus, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſus, Hostienſis,</hi> and <hi>Panormitan</hi>) their Popiſh Councels (as, the 5. Roman vnder <hi>Symachus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Councel of Baſill</hi>) yea, the very Canon law, <hi>Si Papa. Dist.</hi> 40. grant, and dogmatize, to weet, <hi>That the Pope may erre, not onely in precepts of manners; but more then ſo, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of faith, and alſo be an heretike.</hi> Among the ſyno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall Epiſtles in the Councels of <hi>Baſill,</hi> thus wee read: <hi>Many Popes are ſaide to haue fallen into errours and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies. It is certain, that the Pope may erre. The Councell hath often times condemned the Pope, in reſpect, as vvell of his hereſie in faith, as of his lewdneſſe in life.</hi> And touching the Canon law in this point, <hi>Panormitan de Electio. et Elect. poteſt. ca. Significasti,</hi> writeth thus: <hi>The Councell may condemne the Pope of Hereſie, as in Dist.</hi> 40. <hi>Si Papa: where it is ſaide, that the Pope may be an heretike, and may be iudged, and condemned of Hereſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:19639:40"/>
               <p>VVho then could haue thought, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would haue beene ſo ſhameleſſe a flatterer of the Pope, as to write that <hi>the Pope can not erre?</hi> according to that of <hi>Alphonſus</hi> againſt Hereſies, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>ca.</hi> 4. <hi>Non credo aliquem eſſe adeò impudentem Papae aſſentatorem, vt ei tribuere hoc velit, vt nec errare, nec in interpretatione lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarum ſacraru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hallucinari poſsit. I do not think, that there is any one ſo impudent a flatterer of the Pope, as to ſay, he can not erre, or be deceiued in interpretation of the Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude; I would learne of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> what anſwere he will make to this queſtion of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon 1. Cor. chap. 7. thus: <hi>If it be true which ſome aſſert, That the Pope can neuer erre iudiciouſly; vvhat vſe is there of general Councells, or of learned Diuines, or Lawyers in thoſe Councells; vvherefore lyeth an appeale to the Councell, or to the Pope himſelfe better taught; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould there be any Vniuerſities; or any in them, to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, or diſquiet themſelues in the questions of faith; vvhen as all men may learne the certaine truth of one man onely? how commeth it to paſſe, that the decrees of one Pope, are contrary to the decrees of another Pope?</hi> And further I wil demaund, why the Pope ſuffereth ſo many controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies to be vndecided? for example, theſe three:

No<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enim dicimus,</hi> The Kings Primacy, <hi>Regis Primatum, ſed</hi> The Kings Supremacy, <hi>Regis Suprematum: Quo vocabulo nos quoque deinceps vte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:19639:44"/>Multùm enim differunt Primatus &amp; Suprematus.

            <p n="2">2. Out of which words, wee gather two things. The one, that all Engliſhmen, vvho vſe the Name of <hi>Primacie,</hi> doe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther erre or ſpeake improperly, if vve beleeue M. <hi>Tompſon.</hi> For if they ſpeake propertie; ſeeing that the vvord <hi>Primacy</hi> doth properly ſiguifie a Power of the ſame Order; they doe plainely vnderſtand that the King hath Power of the ſame order with the Biſhops and Miniſters of his Church. But this now according to M. <hi>Tompſons</hi> opinion, is an error: wherefore either they doe erre, or ſpeake improperly.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The other is, that a Coniecture may be made of the thing ſignified, from the word ſignifying. The vvord <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie</hi> is a new and lately inuented vvord, vnknowne to the Ancient Fathers, not vſed in Scriptures, vnheard of in the Chriſtian world.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, vvhat doth it ſignifie? The Supreme power (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) of the King in the Church? Wherefore this is new alſo. Surely, if the ancient Fathers, either Latine or Greeke, had knowne this power, they would haue found out at leaſt ſom word, whereby to haue expreſſed the ſame properly.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>R. Thomſon</hi> hath deuiſed a new Latin name, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the ſelfe ſame thing, and the ſelfe ſame Engliſh name of the ſame thing: Therefore the thing it ſelfe is new.</p>
               <p>The Fathers of the Nicene Councell deuiſed a new name, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19639:45"/>Take heede <hi>Becane</hi> of ſuch a conſequent.</p>
               <p>Thus rather perhaps the ſequell would runne more roundly: The name (Ieſuits) is new; Therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruedly may the Ieſuits be called, as blaſphemous, ſo new, ſectaries. Indeede, if the ancient Fathers had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the power of <hi>Vniuerſall Biſhoppe,</hi> they would haue found, at leaſt, one word, whereby to haue expreſſed the ſame properly: eſpecially conſidering that (if we will beleeue <hi>Gregory</hi> the great).<note place="margin">Gregor. li. 4.

                  <hi>To aſſume that arrogant, profane, ſacrilegious, &amp; Antichriſtian name, of Vniuerſall Biſhoppe; is all one, and the ſame, as to be the king of pride:</hi> Lucifer, <hi>who ſet himſelfe before his brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren: to be an Apostate from the faith, and the forerunner of Antichriſt.</hi>

                  <hi>Let not the Biſhop of the first Sea, be called the Prince of Prieſts, or high Prieſt, or any the like: but onely the Biſhop of the firſt Sea; but let not the very Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>be called Vniuerſall Biſhop.</hi>

               <p>Let <hi>Becane</hi> tell me which of the ancient Fathers, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acknowledged the Popes ſupreme power ouer the whole Church; or in proprietie of ſpeech, and, as proper vnto him, called the ſame <hi>Primacy:</hi> touching which, <hi>Chryſostom,</hi> as hee is cited in the Canon law,<note place="margin">Diſt. 40 Multi.</note> writeth thus: <hi>Whoſoeuer ſhall deſire Primacy in earth ſhall finde confuſion in heauen: neither ſhall he be numbred among the ſerwants of Chriſt, who doth handle, or contend for Primacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His ſecond conſequence is this: M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Thomſon</hi> deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a new word or name, whereby to expreſſe in Latin more fully and properly (as be tooke it) the Engliſh word <hi>Supremacy:</hi> Therefore whoſoeuer doe not call <hi>Supremacy,</hi> in Latin, <hi>Suprematum,</hi> ſpeake improperly.

               <p>As for the Latine name <hi>Primatus,</hi> into the which the Engliſh word <hi>Supremacy</hi> is tranſlated, we all agree therein alſo.

In regard whereof, S. <hi>Paul</hi> depainteth this <hi>Becane</hi> (as hee ſheweth himſelfe here to be) in his orient colour thus:<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.4</note>

               <p>HEre haue we the Ieſuit lying in his byrdlime: Wherin, the more he ſtruggleth, the worſe he is enwrapped; and whence he ſeeks to go out, by going out of his wits, ſaying it was his coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:19639:49"/>from no conſequent of reaſon. As though euery coniecture reaſonable, doth not leane vpon ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon probable. If therefore his coniecture was groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon no reaſon, it followeth, that he with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture, was vnreaſonable. But with what face (vnleſſe hee be extreamely ignorant in the very petite rules of Logick) can hee deny it to bee a conſequent, ſtanding vpon two Propoſitions, reduced by himſelfe into forme Enthymematicall. The later (the Concluſion) inferred vpon the former, containing the <hi>Medium</hi> in it, viz. <hi>a new name impoſed,</hi> with the particle-note of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or conſequence, viz. <hi>Igitur (therefore)</hi> &amp; hauing his forerunner-watch-word <hi>colligimus (wee gather)</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing warning of a conſequent to follow.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>What thing ſoeuer hath a new name impoſed vpon it, that thing is new.</hi> Hence the Ieſuit aſſumed thus:</p>

                  <hi>But the Kings Supreme power in the Church, hath a new name,</hi> Suprematus, <hi>impoſed vpon it.</hi> Ergo, <hi>the Kings Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy is new.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I thence aſſumed thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Christ, in reſpect of his Deity, had in the</hi> Nicen <hi>Councell a new name, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <l>Euery man is a liuing creature.</l>

               <p>THe vniforme concord, in the thing it ſelfe, &amp; name of the thing, hath bin heertofore in this booke demonſtrated ſufficiently.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:19639:50"/>which appeareth the rather to be true, becauſe hee ſeemes heere to behold things, and like, which are eucry way vnlike.</p>
               <p>As firſt, thoſe Fathers did not deuiſe a new word, for the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> was long before: onely they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed it as a new attribute to Chriſt, in reſpect of his Godhead: but M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Thomſons</hi> word, <hi>Suprematus,</hi> is ſpanne new.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Fathers held them for hereticks, who did vſe the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Becane</hi> heere ſaith: but M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Thomſon</hi> holdeth our King, the Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to be orthodoxall profeſſors, who vſe the word <hi>Primatus.</hi> So that heer at enothing but diſsimilitudes, vnleſſe it be in this; that as the Fathers deuiſed a new name, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> to aboliſh that as <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="3">3.

Doctor <hi>Andrewes,</hi> or the Kings Chaplaine, in his <hi>Torture of Tortus pag. 90.</hi> where he writeth thus: <hi>Neque verò quoad ſpiritalia, alium nos Regi Primatum tribuimus, neque quoad temporalia alium Pontifici detrahimns, quàm debemus. Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or ille Regibus omni iure, poſtertor hic Pontifici nullo iure debetur.</hi> Neither doe we attribute one Primacy, concerning ſpirituall matters vnto the King, nor doe wee take from the Pope any other Primacy, concerning temporall matters, then vvee ought to doe. The firſt is due vnto Kings by all right, the later no way pertaineth to the Pope &amp;c. I, vvhen I firſt read theſe vvords in the Chaplaines booke, did thinke that hee had taken theſe two, towit, <hi>Primacy ſpirituall</hi> and <hi>belonging to ſpirituall;</hi> as alſo theſe other, <hi>Primacy temporall,</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to temporall,</hi> for one and the ſame thing.

And M. <hi>Tompſon, pag. 31.</hi> of his Booke, alſo ſaith: <hi>Non dixit, Primatum Eccleſiaſticum, aut Spiritualem, quaſi formaliterintelligat; ſed quoad Spiritualia, ideſt, obiectiuè &amp; materialiter.</hi> The Chaplaine ſaid not, the Primacy Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall or Spirituall, as though hee vnder ſtood it form ally; but for ſo much as it belong eth to Spiritual, that is to ſay, obiectiuely and materially &amp;c.

            <p n="4">4. So as if you aske in <hi>England,</hi> whether the King hath Primacy Eccleſiaſticall or no? It will be anſwered thus: King <hi>Henry, K.

Hath then his Maieſtie that now is leſſe then they had? So it ſeemes. Is then the Kings Primacy in <hi>England</hi> ſo nipped and pared in ſo ſhort a ſpace? So they ſay. Is it then almoſt decayed, and at anend? I doubt not but it is. What is the cauſe?

               <p>IN my <hi>Concord</hi> booke I ſhewed, in generall and in particular, the <hi>Regall Primacy</hi> vnder K. <hi>Iames</hi> to be the ſelfe ſame, which was vnder K. <hi>Henry,</hi> K. <hi>Edward,</hi> and Q. <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> adding that it ſo would continue, as certainely it will, during this orthodoxall Religion among vs: which I hope ſhall continue ſo long as the ſunne and moone endure; though the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiticall, and all other Papiſticall bowels burſt thereat.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:19639:56"/>
               <p>I ſhewod it in general; for that, the <hi>Supremacie</hi> then was, and now, no leſſe, is, <hi>The kings Supreme power, in, and ouer, all cauſes, and all perſons</hi> (within his kingdom) <hi>Spirituall</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſticall;</hi> and therefore in the ſelfe ſame lawes of this kingdome, then, and now in force, called <hi>The kings ſupreme Power Spirituall or Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In particular, I demonſtrated the ſame, by ſetting downe the moſt materiall points, out of the expreſſe words of Scirpture, wherein the kings ſaide <hi>Supreme power Spirituall or Eccleſiaſticall</hi> conſiſteth: in which ſaide, both generall, and particular points, as there they are ſet downe, all Engliſh Proteſtant Writers with full conſent agree, without any Iarre, or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>If this ſhallow Ieſuite had had any ſound matter in him, in this his <hi>Exame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> he would haue anſwered to the matter, eſpecially to thoſe materiall points founded vpon the Scriptures; and haue proued, that either thoſe particular points belong not to the office of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall <hi>Supremacy:</hi> or elſe that wee Proteſtant Writers, iarre in ſome one or moe of thoſe ſaid materiall points gathered by the R.

            <p>MAiſter <hi>Henry Salclebridge</hi> doth abſolutely affirme it. For thus be writeth pag. <hi>140. Dico, Regem An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliae Eccleſiae Anglicanae Primatem eſſe.</hi> I ſay, that the King of England is Primat of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.

For ſo he ſaith pag. 177. <hi>Angliae Rege<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Anglicanae Eccleſiae Primate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſſe, in profeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one publica Anglicana Veritasis, ſacris liter is nixae, ponitur.</hi> That the King of England, is Primate of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, is founded in the publique Engliſh Profeſſion of Truth, grounded vpon the ſacred Letter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. M. <hi>Tooker.</hi> and M. <hi>Burhill</hi> doe abſolutely deny it. For thus writeth M. <hi>Tooker</hi> pag. 3. <hi>Olere autem malitiam, ac cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitare audaciam tuam illud videtur, cùm Rege<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Caput Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae, Primatemque conſingas.</hi> It may ſeeme to ſauour of malice, and cry out vpon your ſaucineſſe, when as you feigne the King Head, and Primate of the Church, &amp;c. And Ma. <hi>Burhill,</hi> pag. <hi>133, Nec primatem quidem omnino Regem noſtrum dicimus; multò vetò minus Primatem Eccleſiaſticiſm,</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe wee at all, call our King Primate; and much leſſe Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteſiaſticall Frimate, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Heer-hence doe I frame a twofold Argument. One out of M. <hi>Tookera</hi> words in this manner: Hee that affirmeth the King to be Primate of the Church, is a ſauſy and malicious fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. But M. <hi>Salclebridge</hi> affirmeth the King to be Primate of the Church. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he is a ſauſy and malicious fellow. The other argument I frame out of M. <hi>Salclebridges</hi> words thus: He that denieth the King to bee Primate of the Church, doth offend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the publique Profeſſion of the Truth receiued in England. But M. <hi>Tooker</hi> denieth the King to be Primate of the Church of England. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he offendeth againſt the publique profeſſion of the Truth receiued in England. So (I wis) one Mule claweth another.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But now it may bee demaunded, whether of them doth iudge more rightly in this caſe, M. <hi>Salclebridge,</hi> who affirmeth the King to be Primate of the Church, or M. <hi>Tooker,</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth it? This controuerſie dependeth vpon another queſtion, to weet, whether theſe two Names, <hi>Primate,</hi> and <hi>Primacy,</hi> are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily connexed, or, as they ſay, <hi>Coniugata?</hi> M. <hi>Salclebridge</hi> thinketh that they are. Therfore, becauſe he hath once affirmed
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:19639:59"/>the King to haue the Primacy of the Church, hee conſequently anerreik, that the King is Primat of the Church. For that with him this Argument hath force <hi>à Coniugatis:</hi> The King hath Primacy, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the King is Primate. As alſo this: The Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine hath a Biſhoprick, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he is a Biſhop.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Now M. <hi>Tooker,</hi> hee thinketh the contrarie. For pag. 6. of his booke hee expreſty ſaith: That the King hath the Primacy of the Church; but yet hee is not the Primate of the Church. And contrariwiſe, The Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> hath not the Primacy of the Church; &amp; yet is he Primate of the Church. So as hee denieth theſe two conſequences <hi>à Coniugatis,</hi> to weet. I. The King hath the Primacy, <hi>Ergo,</hi> hee is Primate. 2. The Archbiſhoppe is Primate, <hi>Ergo,</hi> hee hath the Primacy. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps hee vvill deny theſe in like manner. I. The Chaplaine hath a Biſhopricke <hi>Ergo,</hi> hee is a Biſhop. 2. M. <hi>Tooker</hi> is a Deane, <hi>Ergo,</hi> hee hath a Deanery.</p>

               <p>Indeed, with the Papiſts, what is the Papall <hi>Primat</hi> of the Church, but the <hi>Supreame Head</hi> of the Church? Therefore iuſtly I found fault with the Ieſuit, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king two queſtions of one. viz. I. <hi>Whether the King bee Primat of the Church? 2. Whether the King be Supreme Head of the Church?</hi> and not thus rather, according to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:19639:60"/>his words and meaning: <hi>Whether the king be Head or Primate of the Church; or Head, that is, Primate, &amp;c.</hi> But in this his <hi>Examen,</hi> the Ieſuite doth increaſe (and not leſſen) the Iarre with himſelfe.</p>

               <p>TRue it is, in our Engliſh tongue, as we doe not call the kings Supreme gouernment of this Church, <hi>Primacy,</hi> but <hi>Supremacy:</hi> ſo doe we not cell the king, <hi>Primate Eccleſiasticall,</hi> or <hi>Primate</hi> at all.

               <p>But I'le returne this his argument vpon his owne head thus: If D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Tooker,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Burbill</hi> deny the King to be <hi>Primate,</hi> or to haue <hi>Primacy</hi> in that denſe than <hi>Becane</hi> ſaith <hi>The King vſurpeth Primacy;</hi> and <hi>Becane</hi> ſaith <hi>The King vſurpeth Primacy Sacerdotall,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall: Then it followeth that they deny the King to be Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, or to haue Primacy Epiſcopall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the firſt is true, according to <hi>Becane;</hi> viz. <hi>That the deny, as Becane meaneth; and Becane meaneth that the King vſurpeth Primacy Epiſcopall.</hi>

Let him therfore turne to the <hi>Clementines</hi> of Pope <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the 5. <hi>Title</hi> 3. <hi>De Haereticis. cap. Ad veſtrum,</hi> and there, vpon the Text-word, <hi>Eccleſiae,</hi> in the Gloſſe, (which is cited by the learnedſt Canoniſts for good Canon law) he ſhal find written theſe very words and ſullables: <hi>Omnes igitur ſunt ſubiecti motioni illius (Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pae): et ſunt in illo, quaſi membra de membro.</hi> de Elect. <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificaſti.

For this, let him turn to <hi>Diſt.</hi> 40. <hi>cap. Si Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa.</hi> There ſhall he heare <hi>Boniface</hi> the Martyr vttering theſe Text Canonicall words; <hi>If the Pope, negligent of the ſaluation of his own ſonle, &amp; of others, ſhould draw with him, by heapes, innumerable people, to be tortured with him by many plagues, or helliſh torments eternally, they all muſt be ſo ſubiect to that his drawing motion, that hee may not be rebuked of any of them for that motion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or admit the Popes <hi>motion</hi> were, <hi>to forbid vertue, &amp; to command vice:</hi> then (as ſaith <hi>Bellarmine) the vvhole Church, must be ſo ſubiect to that motion, as to belieue, that vice is good, and vertue euill, vnleſſe they will ſin against conſcience.</hi> Is not this lowly good infernall ſubiection?

               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:19639:67"/>
               <p>But why doth the Ieſuit preſume, to tell the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that Author, whom, as hee heere confeſleth, he knoweth not? Let him learne more modeſtie heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; and in the meane time knowe, that <hi>for members to be ſubiect to the motion of their Head</hi> (for example, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to their <hi>Pope-Head</hi>) is, not onely to obey the commaund of their head (as if the legges ſhould moue, when the head would haue them moue) but to receine the <hi>vertue of motion</hi> from the <hi>head,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, they cannot moue at all.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that in great diſtemperatures of the head, as Apoplexies, or the like, the members are void of all motion. And ſo it fareth with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and their <hi>Pope-Head:</hi> from whom, as from their <hi>Head</hi> (ſo ſaith their Canon) euen their <hi>Head of faith, GOD powreth out his gifts</hi> (the gifts of <hi>moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>) into <hi>all the members.</hi> Yet in ſuch ſort, as that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partaking of the <hi>Pope-Head, GOD</hi> (ſaith <hi>Leo) powreth no gift or grace into any member.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God for bidde wee ſhould acknowledge the King to be ſuch an <hi>Head of motion,</hi> or wee bee ſubiect to any ſuch motion. His Maieſtie deteſteth any ſuch claime: and wee dereſt all ſuch ſubiection. So little is the King preiudicated by this quotation.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Thus haue I gathered, out of the blaſphemous aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of this Ieſuit here, and out of their Canon law, enough for this one time, and to much for <hi>Becane</hi> to anſwere all his life time, againſt their <hi>Pope-Head.</hi>

               <p>But how doth the Ieſuit gather, that the Sacrament of preaching was principally conſtituted in <hi>Peter,</hi> when, after the veſſell let downe, it was ſaid vnto him, <hi>Riſe Peter, kill and eate?</hi> ſeeing that Chriſt before his pasſion, did conſtitute the Sacrament of preaching, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually

Therefore by that ſpeech and viſion, he was embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to preach the Goſpell to <hi>Cornelius</hi> a Gentile; but not to kill <hi>Cornelius,</hi> as Cardinall <hi>Baronius</hi> expounded thoſe words againſt the Venetians.</p>
               <p>If the Ieſuite had cited the whole words of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, as he promiſed to doe, he might haue learned by thoſe words of the Canon, <hi>Dexteras Societatis: the right hands of Fellowſhip;</hi> that <hi>the Sacrament of preaching the Goſpell, was as principally conſtituted in</hi> Paul <hi>towards the Gentiles, as it was in</hi> Peter <hi>towards the Iewes.</hi>

               <p>As touching me, I had read that Canon often: but I purpoſely cited, out of it, thoſe words onely which ſhew, what a blaſphemous <hi>Head</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath, who challengeth to be <hi>aſſumpted into the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the indiuiduall vnitie,</hi> in ſuch ſort, that <hi>all gifts and graces of God, are powred vpon the Church from him, and through him, as the Head of that his body, the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thoſe words which I cited, were not <hi>maimed,</hi> but full enough to euince the Pope to be ſuch a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous <hi>Head</hi> indcede. Notwithſtanding, I muſt giue the Ieſuite leaue to hold on his courſe, viz. to wound his Pope, when he ſeeks to heale him; to diſgrace mee without cauſe, and to bely mee, without bluſhing.</p>

               <p>Heretofore the Pope was ſaid to be, not ſimply, the <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> as Chriſt is; but the <hi>inferiour-mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall Head:</hi> now hee is growen to be the <hi>Supreme Head,</hi> equall with Chriſt, as <hi>hauing the ſame Tribunall and Conſistorie,</hi> that Chriſt hath, and being <hi>able to doe all that Chriſt can doe.</hi> To proue this, I cited the words

(<hi>To excommunicate, abſolue, viſit, inſtitute, conferre benefices, preſent to Benefices, Prelatures, and Dignities Eccleſiasticall: and to haue all Adminiſtration of the Moneſteriall Monialls, or Nunnes; as well Spirituall, as Temporall; but onely thoſe things of order, vvhereof a vvoman is incapeable.) ex Tractatu doctiſsimo,</hi> out of the moſt learned Treatiſe, of Father <hi>Stephen</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Aluin,</hi> entituled thus: <hi>A Treatiſe of the Power of the Abbats and Abbeſſes:</hi> printed at <hi>Pariſe</hi> 1607. authorized ſolemnly to be printed; and in very ſingular manner allowed with high commendation, by the Diuines of <hi>Pariſe,</hi> deputed for examination of all bookes to be printed there.</p>
               <p>In my margine notes I directed the Ieſuite to the particular chapters of that Treatiſe, where the ſaid <hi>Stephen</hi> doth not onely aſſert thoſe particulars; but alſo ſolidly and indiciouſly proue the ſame, by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non law, and beſt Canoniſts writing comment, vpon that law. Notwithſtanding, this Ieſuite, as though his noſe bled, turneth aſide from all theſe (ſo many words,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:19639:77"/>ſo many preſſures of him) and ſaith but this: It is falſe, Abbeſſes with vs haue no power to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate.</p>
               <p>Did euer any Ieſuite ſo vnlearned as this <hi>Becane</hi> is, and here ſhewes himſelfe to be, vvrite with penne? <hi>Stephen D'Aluin,</hi> doth not only ſay it, but from ſound premiſſes conclude it. The Ieſuit, leauing the premiſſes vnanſwered, or vntouched, denieth the concluſion; and ſinking vnder the burden of the reſpondent, will rather play the opponents part, and ſo obiecteth theſe two emptie Canons nothing to the purpoſe.<note place="margin">23. q 5. cap Multerem.</note> The former is of priuate women, that they ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to their husbands: and not vſurpe authoritie ouer other men, as, to teach them publikely, to iudge them, to rule, or raigne ouer them, to weet, as the Gloſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it, in temporalls.</p>
               <p>If this Canon ſhould be vnderſtood generally of all women (for Abbeſſes are not there once mentioned) then <hi>Mathilda</hi> Counteſs, of whom the Gloſs in <hi>L. vlt. cod. de Arbit.</hi> maketh ſuch honorable mention, could not command or iudge them, who were her ſubiects as Counteſs: nor Q. <hi>Mary</hi> (ſo much commended by al Papiſts) might raigne, as Queen, ouer her Engliſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.

Out of vvhich teſtimonie vves may gather, that the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> cannot aſſemble a Councell of kis ovvne authoritie. Not a Generall, becauſe that belongeth to the common conſent of Kings and Emperours. Not a Prouinciall, becauſe that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to the Metropolitan.

And thence irrefragably concluded, our King to bee <hi>Primate and Head,</hi> that is, <hi>Supreme Gouernour of this Church.</hi> Which is all one, as if he had taken from <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane</hi> his owne cudgell, and beaten him ſoundly black and blew therewith, as became <hi>Becano-Baculus</hi> to do.</p>
               <p>Yet Chriſtian Reader, conſider what iuſt cauſe <hi>Hainric</hi> had, and I haue here, to vrge the Ieſuite, to ſhew, eſpecially in this particular, what generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:19639:88"/>cell <hi>Peter</hi> did call, as <hi>Primate;</hi> or what Scripture or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Father did attribute to <hi>Peter,</hi> as <hi>Primate,</hi> any power to <hi>call generall Councells.</hi> All the Ieſuites in the world, with all the learning and reading they haue, can not ſhew it. Whence neceſſarily, by Popiſh rule, it will follow, that <hi>Peter</hi> was not <hi>Supreme Primate</hi> of the whole Church; and conſequently, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is not <hi>Supreme Primate</hi> of the ſaid Church.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, our Writers haue, out of the Scriptures, and Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories demonſtrated, that the moſt religious; both, Kings vnder the Law, and Emperours vnder the Goſpell, haue called general Councels, for which they are, generally, greatly, and worthily commended. The Ieſuite knowing this to be moſt true, and not able to anſwere it, runnes into his ſtarting hole, and ſaith, that it is not to the matter; when inceed it ſticks in the very bowels of the matter, and hangs ſo fixedly in the Popes liuer, as no Ieſuiticall Dictamne can draw it forth.</p>
               <p>In this one point of Regall Supremacy, the Ieſuite can not produce any two of our Writers, who doe not fully agree. As for <hi>Hainric</hi> and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Tooker,</hi> they both write vniformally, that it belongeth to orthodoxall Kings and Emperors, when any ſuch are, to call Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells. Here therefore the Ieſuite, being at a <hi>non-plus,</hi> and brought to his ſhifts, faineth a Iarre betweene D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Tooker</hi> and himſelfe. Well, then belike when <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> in his writings differeth from himſelfe, that is, at leaſt an hundred times, thoſe diſcords muſt be ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Popiſh Iarres:</hi> but how doth <hi>Becane</hi> proue that D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Tooker</hi> is in this point againſt himſelfe? Forſooth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he faith, that the Apoſtles (viz. when there was
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:19639:88"/>no Chriſtian Emperour) by diuine right, called a Councell. Then the argument runneth thus: <hi>All the Apostles ioyntly in time of Perſecution, lawfullie called one Councell onely, of ſome few perſons within one Citie. Therfore, in time of Peace, not Chriſtian Emperours, but onely, and all, Biſhops in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an vvorld, ioyntly muſt call all generall Councells, throughout the vvhole Chriſtian vvorld.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What cable, ſtrong enough, and long enough, can the Ieſuit get, from all the Ieſuiticall crue, ſo to tye theſe together, that the conſequence may hold for good? For heere is a manifold <hi>Non ſequitur;</hi> 1. From one particular act of Apoſtles, to a generall rule of all Biſhops. 2. From times of Perſecution, to times of Peace. 3. From times when there were no Chriſtian Emperours to call Councells, vnto times when there were ſome to call, and indeed did call, all &amp; euery one of the moſt renowned generall and orthodoxal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, to weet, the firſt ſix of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becane</hi> dare not ſay, that the 4. firſt generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells (which Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the great eſteemed as the 4. Euangeliſts) were vnlawfully, or againſt diuine right, indicted or called; yet were they all called by Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and not by Popes. viz. The firſt <hi>Nicen</hi> Councell, by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great: The firſt Councell of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> by <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the firſt: The firſt Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> by the Emperor <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the ſecond: The firſt Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> by the Emperour <hi>Martian.</hi> Vnto which Councells, the Emperours by their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, called as well the Popes of Rome, as other Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs.</p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:19639:89"/>
               <p>If Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the firſt, had knowne any ſuch <hi>diuine right,</hi> of calling generall Councells to be in him, and not in the Emperour, hee would neeuer have ſtooped ſo baſely, as ſuppliant vpon his knees, to entreat the Emperour, and the Empreſſe, by himſelfe, and by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to call a generall Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell: for what elſe had this beene, but treacherouſly to requeſt the Emperour to bereaue him of his <hi>Diuine right</hi> (as <hi>Becane</hi> heere calls it) and by uſurped power, to be practiſed by the call of generall Councells, to extinguiſh that <hi>Diuine right, &amp; Popiſh Primacy.</hi> That is, to extinguiſh their <hi>Catholick faith.</hi> For now the Papall Supremacie, is the very ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall and maine point, of their <hi>Catholick faith.</hi>

Or whether Patriarchs be ſucceſſors of ſome of the Apoſtles; and Archbiſhops of other-ſome: and Biſhops ſucceſſors of the loweſt, or third rank? And whether one kind onely of theſe ſucceſſors, or all three kinds, may call generall Councells?</p>
               <p>Secondly, whether all the Biſhops in the Chriſtian world, as the Apoſtles ſucceſſors, muſt ioyntly, as all the Apoſtles did, call generall Councells? or (becauſe that would now proue too-too troubleſome) how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them may ſerue that turne?</p>

            <p>THe Apoſtles by diuine right might make lawes. Which right cannot be proued to haue bin tranſtated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them to Kings or Emperours, but to Biſhops, ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles, with whom, as with the Apostles, the Spirit of truth remaineth for euer.

Are all Biſhops God immediate choſen witneſſes to teſtifie the truth, ſo without all posſibility of falſhood, that the Churches faith ſhould depend thereon ſo ſure, that if an Angell of heauen teſtifie other wiſe, then they haue preached or written, he ſhould be accurſed? Then muſt writings, teſtimonies, and lawes hereticall, go for Scripture Canonical; and ſo Diuine Scripture muſt be hereticall.</p>

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:19639:93"/>truth had ſo forſaken, and the lying ſpirit of hereſic had ſo poſſeſſed in a manner all the Biſhoppes in the Chriſtian world; that, as <hi>Hierom</hi> againſt the Lucife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans ſaith, <hi>Ingemuit totus orbis, et Arianum ſe eſſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus est.

               <p>For further anſwere to the Ieſuite here, firſt I ſay that the aforeſaid immediate Diuine inſpiration, was perſonall and proper to the Apoſtles, and not tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue or deriuatiue, from the Apoſtles to Biſhops; as in my <hi>Engliſh Concord</hi> by foure ſeuerall teſtimonies, out of <hi>Augustine</hi> the moſt learned Biſhop that euer wrote, I proued directly and expreſſely: whereunto this emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty prattling Ieſuite anſwereth not one word.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly I ſay, that thoſe words of our Saniour, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>The Spirit of truth ſhall remaine with you for euer;</hi> are meant as well of Paſtors and Teachers, as of Biſhops: for Chriſt when he aſcended <hi>gaue not onely Apostles, Prophets, Euangeliſts and Biſhops; but alſo Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Doctours for the worke of the miniſterie,</hi>

               <p>MY reaſon to prooue the Apoſtles lawes and Canons to be of greater force and authority to binde the conſcience, was not ſimply be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are found written in the Scripture, as the Ordinance of <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> is: but becauſe they are ſet downe there, not only as Canons or Doctrines allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but alſo as Eſſentiall parts of holy writte and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Scripture: ſo neither <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> Ordinance was, not any Law or Canon of Biſhop, was, is, or euer ſhall be.

                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:19639:95"/>The Canons and Doctrines of the Apoſtles, are the foundations whereupon the Church of <hi>Christ is built,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.20</note> and containe that abſolute certainety of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine truth, that <hi>If an Angell from heauen ſhould teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he ſhould be accurſed.</hi> Agreeable to that of Saint <hi>Augustine, Contra liter.

Bee it of any thing that pertaines to faith or maners, I do not ſay, if vve, but if an Angel from heauen, preach otherwiſe, then is ſet down in the ſcriptures Legal &amp; Euangelicall, let him be accurſed.</hi> But of all other Lawes, Canons, and Writings, <hi>Origen</hi> in his firſt Homilie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Hieremy</hi> writeth thus: <hi>Senſus nostri, et enarrationes ſine his testibus non habent fidem.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That the Apoſtles Canons &amp; Doctrines ſet downe in Scripture, are but <hi>humane Canons and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</hi> Which, then ſaith <hi>Auguſtine, de vnitat.

               <p>Behold then, how a threefold Concord ariſeth out of that threefold Iarre which the Ieſuit faineth.</p>
               <p>The firſt Concord: <hi>Hainric</hi> ſaith, that the confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of certain Benefices belongs to the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by way of lapſe, as they are the chief Gouernours of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> Doctor <hi>Tooker</hi> affirmeth,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:19639:101"/>that the Collation of Benefices, lying void of any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbents aboue 18. Monethes, appertaineth to the King onely by way of lapſe: and not to the Biſhops or Archbiſhops; or to any other ſubiect.</p>
               <p>The ſecond: <hi>Hainric</hi> ſaith, that Kings by their own authority, haue oftentimes giuen Benefices: to weet, Donatiues. <hi>Tooker</hi> auerreth that the King may giue 40. 50. or moe, within the compaſſe of one yeare, if ſo many fall void.</p>
               <p>The third: <hi>Hainric</hi> ſaith, that by the lawes of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Kings, becauſe of their Supreme Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction, preſent to free Chappels; and that none of their ſubiects, to weet, Biſhoppes or Archbiſhops, haue authority to viſit the ſaid Chappels: D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Tooker,</hi> inſtructed by the ſame lawes, auoucheth that Kings onely haue that authority, and no ſubiects, but by the Kings grant.</p>
               <p>Finally, if the hungry Ieſuite, (who mindeth onely his meat, that is, far Benefices, or Archbiſhoprickes) can produce but one little, either word of Scripture, or ſentence in Ancient Father, whereby it may appeare that the Collation of Benefices belonged to the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> of the Chriſtian Church as <hi>Primate;</hi> let him haue the victory: But if he cannot, vnleſſe hee be more then impudent, let him ſeale vp his lips, and recognize thoſe words of the Pariſian Aduocate, <hi>Arg.</hi> 11. <hi>Page</hi> 25. <hi>That of Luk.</hi> 9. <hi>The Sonne of man hath not vvhere to rest his head;</hi> is <hi>Equiualent, with this: The Church by Diuine right hath no Territory.</hi>

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:19639:102"/>it can be ſhewed that Collation of Benefices belonged, as proper, to the ſaid Primate Eccleſiaſticall; yet hee would encounter him therein, and beat him with his owne weapon: as he did ſoundly, prouing that good Emperours, haue giuen Popedoms, and that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Canon Law: That Catholike Kings by their prerogatiue Regall, haue giuen, as to this day they giue, Archbiſhopricks, Biſhopricks, and other Benefices.</p>

               </p>
               <p>How ridiculous is this Ieſuit here? <hi>Hainrie,</hi> as hath appeared, denied the Collation of Benefices to belong to the Supreme Primate Epiſcopall; yet ſuppoſed that it did appertaine to a Supreme Primate, to weet, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall; that thereby he might cudgell the Ieſuite with his owne weapon, and according to <hi>Becane</hi> his diſpute, proue the King to be Primate, to weet, Regall, becauſe the Collatiò of Benefices belongs vnto him.

               <p>Moreouer, Doctour <hi>Tooker, Page.</hi> 37. writeth, Rex concedit ſuam regiam licentiam eligendi. <hi>As often as it happeneth to any Cathedrall Church to be destitute of a
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:19639:108"/>Biſhoppe, then the King by a vvritte, giueth licence to the Deane and Chapter, to elect another perſon Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I will btiefely declare vnto thee (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) the whole proceſſe and carriage of this election: for it is common and vulgar euery day. Thus there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it proceedeth: When any Cathedrall Church wanteth his Paſtor, the King ſendeth foorth his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Writte <hi>Conge Deſtire,</hi> directed to the Deane and Chapter; commaunding them with all ſpeed, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble and to chooſe an Archbiſhoppe, or Biſhop, for their Sea: but with this <hi>prouiſo;</hi> that they chooſe no other, than that perſon which ſhall be named by the King, vnder the penaltie of a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> (which is the greateſt puniſhment among vs in <hi>England,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept death.) And the ſame Archbiſhop, or Biſhoppe ſo named by the King, and elected as aforeſaide, muſt be conſecrated by the Archbiſhop, or Biſhops, vnder the ſame penalty.</p>
               <p>Now conſider learned Reader (for I will make thee my iudge) what other thing is this, then to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Archbiſhoppes and Biſhoppes? excepting one, lie ceremoniall formalities. But let vs ſuffer that moſt bleſſed Martyr, Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> to reſt in glory with Chriſt in heanen. This Iarre and difference is of great momenn, (I meane betwixt the Papiſts and vs) for if it appeare as cleare as the light, both by the Popes Canon lawes, &amp; alſo by open Tables of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Hiſtories, as our moſt drad Soueraine hath moſt exactly demonſtrated, that the <hi>Romane</hi> Emperor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; elected Popes, &amp; ſet in order the Sea Apoſtolike:
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:19639:109"/>And if all Archbiſhoppes and Biſhops, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Prouinces, receiued their Inueſtitures from them: (according to the popiſh VVriters, eſpecially the Ieſuits) all thoſe <hi>Romane</hi> Biſhops which haue been ſo created and elected for many hundred yeares (to omit all inſeriour Archbiſhops and Biſhops) <hi>Non ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titerunt Paſtores intrantes per ostium in ouile, ſed Praedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes aliunde aſcendentes, haue not beene Pastors entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſheepefolde by the doore, but thieues and robbers aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending another way,</hi> that is, falſe Biſhops, Archbiſhops and Paſtors. Out of which I inferre three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that all the Biſhops ſo created by Emperours and Kings (according to the words of <hi>Genebrarde</hi>) <hi>vvere diſorderly and Apoſtaticall, rather then Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, whatſoeuer was done of them by Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copallauthoritie, or Iuriſdiction, is of no moment, force or validitie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the Biſhops ſo ordained, are bound to reſtitution of all reuene wes and and profits, which they haue reaped by their Biſhopricks.</p>

            <p>YOu uſe three arguments to prone that Doctor. <hi>Too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> agreeth with <hi>Hainric</hi> herein, viz. that Kings may make and depoſe Biſhops. i. <hi>Tooker</hi> embraceth as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxall, all things prooued by the King. But that Kings may create and depoſe Biſhops, was ſoundly proned by the King. Therefore <hi>Tooker</hi> embraceth it as orthodoxall. Heere firſt the <hi>minor</hi> is falſe: for <hi>Tooker</hi> denieth that the King can create and depoſe Biſoops; for hee ſaith that the institution and deſtitntion of inſeriour Prieſts, belongs to Biſhoppes, and not to, Kings: therefore the King hath not ſolidly proued it. Secondly, it may thus bee returned: All Academichs willingly approur all things ſoundly prooued by the King. But the King hath ſoundlie prooued the Pope to be Antichriſt. Therefore the Engliſh A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademicks willingly er<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>HEere haue we the picture of a very vnlearned Ieſuit, whoſe lineaments are drawn with his owne penſill; and which is depainted with his owne liuely colours.</p>
               <p>Firſt, ignorantly hee confoundeth as one, a ſingle narration with a double ratiocination; and the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deſtitution of inferior Prieſts, with the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and depoſition of Biſhops.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he anſwereth two Syllogiſmes, and thoſe produced from his owne forge onely, with denying
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:19639:110"/>the concluſions of both.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he reaſoneth from one indiuiduall, Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Tooker,</hi> to all our Vniuerſitie Academicks. Laſtlie, hee brings in Maiſter <hi>Powell</hi> diſallowing that, which hee chiefely approueth.</p>
               <p>The ſingle natration ſet downe in the <hi>Engliſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,</hi> was thus: Doctor <hi>Tooker,</hi> reading, and well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing his Maieſties ſolidarguments, eſpecially that from exemplary act of <hi>Salomon,</hi> commended in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, viz. in depoſing <hi>Abiathar,</hi> and placing <hi>Zadock,</hi> chiefe Prieſts; was ſo farre from denying the power of Kings to depoſe Biſhops, that he, grounding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vpon the ſaid act of <hi>Solomon,</hi> concluded with the King and <hi>Hainric;</hi> That Emperours may lawfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Popes, and ſo made vp the harmony of all good concord heerein. The Ieſuit transformeth this ſingle narration into a double Syllogiſme: the former thus;</p>
               <p>All which the King hath ſoundly prooued, <hi>Tooker</hi> doth not deny, but embrace, as orthodoxall. But that Kings may depoſe Biſhoppes, the King hath ſoundly proued. Therefore Doctor <hi>Tooker</hi> doth not deny that Kings may depoſe Biſhoppes. To this hee anſwereth thus: Doctor <hi>Tooker</hi> denyeth that Kings may depoſe Biſhops, therefore the King hath not ſolidly prooued it. Then briefely and plainly his aunſwer heere vnto is thus: The concluſion of this ſyllogiſme is falſe. Therefore the <hi>minor</hi> is falſe. Which anſwer procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from extreame ignorance in the very principle of Logick.</p>
               <p>But how proues hee (for hee dare not be Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent heere) the concluſion to be falſe? <hi>Becauſe Doctor</hi> Tooker <hi>denieth the inſtitution and destitution of inferiour
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:19639:110"/>Prieſts to belong to Kings, as beeing proper to Biſhops.</hi> As though inferiour Prieſts and Biſhops were all one. As though inſtitution and deſtitution of Prieſts, were all one with election &amp; depoſition of Biſhops, or Popes. One Biſhop may inſtitute and deſtitute an hundred Prieſts: but one hundred Biſhoppes cannot chooſe or depoſe one Biſhoppe, eſpecially an Archbiſhoppe, or Pope.</p>
               <p>Heere are ſome lineaments &amp; liuely colours of this Ieſuits groſſe ignorance: moe are to be ſeene in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Syllogiſme, following thus; All things ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prooued by the King, all Engliſh Academicks ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue. That the Pope is Antichriſt, was ſoundly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the King: therefore all Engliſh Academicks al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as orthodoxall, the Pope to be Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>To this hee anſwereth thus: <hi>The concluſion is falſe, and the forme good: therefore the</hi> maior <hi>or</hi> minor <hi>is falſe. It skilleth not whether, ſo that one of them be falſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is this elſe, but to his vtter ſhame, to diſplay his intolerable ignorance to the world, and to expoſe it as ludibrious to the meaneſt Academick Sophiſters: who ſhould be well laſhr, or iuſtly exploded if they would aunſwere right formed ſyllogiſmes, by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the concluſions.</p>
               <p>But how doth this Ieſuit proue this later concluſion to be falſe? Becauſe <hi>Gabriell Powell</hi> belieueth this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, viz. that the Pope is Antichriſt, which the King hath ſoundly prooued, to be orthodoxall. Wherein, behold the ſtrange blockiſhnes of this Ieſuit, who ſhould haue inſtauced in one Academick, denying that which the King had ſoundly proued, viz. the Pope to be Antichriſt: but hee brings in Maiſter <hi>Powell</hi> allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  </gap> what the King therein had ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proued.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, if the King did not prooue ſoundlie the Pope to be Antichriſt; then the Ieſuit takes away the <hi>ſuppoſitum,</hi> and ſo ſhe weth himſelfe to be a frivolous Diſputer. If the King did ſolidly proue the Pope to be Antichriſt, why ſhould not Maiſter <hi>Powell</hi> belieue it as orthodoxall?</p>
               <p>The Ieſuit ſaith <hi>The King doth not hold it as certaine:</hi> Reply firſt that is nor <hi>ad idem;</hi> it is no aunſwere to the Syllogiſme, many part thereof. Secondly, though his Maieſtie doth not hold thoſe arguments ſo certain, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> his Maieſtie ſolidly evinceth the ſame, from other places of holy Writ, the meaning whereof is more certaine, cleare, and euident.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth the Ieſuit, that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Prophets are ſubiect to the Prophers; That the Lord reuealeth ſome things to one, which he doth not to another.</p>

               <p>HEere alſo the ignorance of this Ieſuit ſillily miſtaketh the meaning of the <hi>Engliſh Concord</hi> in this point. <hi>Becan,</hi> out of Doctor <hi>Tooker,</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting the King to be a foſter-child, and diſciple of the Biſhops, doth conclude, that therefore Doctor <hi>Tooker</hi> denied the Kings power to rule or depoſe Biſhops.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh Concord,</hi> to proue the weakenes of that conſequence, ſhewed out of Doctor <hi>Tooker,</hi> that thogh Kings were not Biſhops, but ſubiect vnto them, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gand of their Epiſcopall duties, as in hearing the word preached by them, in receiuing of the Sacraments ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred by them; yet in reſpect of ſupreame Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall government, they were rulers ouer Biſhope, and might depoſe them. As King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſine did, who though he diſclaimed Epiſcopall function, yet he claimed and vſed the primacy. But let the argument runne from the primacie of Kings, to conclude their power to depoſe Biſhops. I ſay it holdeth good; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that all Papiſts make the power of depoſing Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, a part of the primacie. And that not one Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Proteſtant Writer, aſcribing the primacie to the King, denieth him the power to depoſe Biſhops.</p>
               <p>Heere is then no begging of that in queſtion, but a ſolid putting that out of queſtion which is contrauer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and ſoundly concluding the power of Kings to depoſe Biſhops.</p>

For they ſay, that the King cannot excommunicate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his ſubiects, &amp; yet himſelfe may be exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated by them, and expelled out of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whereof himſelfe is ſupreame Head. The former part heere of doth Maiſter <hi>Tooker</hi> affirme, pag. 15. in theſe vvords: <hi>Rex non habet poteſtatem diſtringendi gladium ſpiritualem, vel quempiam excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municandi.</hi>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:19639:113"/>The King hath no power to vnſheath the ſpirituall ſword, nor to excommunicate any man, &amp;c. And the Chaplaine, my Lord of <hi>Ely,</hi> pag. 151. ſaith: <hi>Nos Principi cenſurae pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatem non facimus.</hi> Wee doe not giue authoritie to our Prince to vſe Cenſures. &amp;c. And againe, Maiſter <hi>Thomſon,</hi> pag. <hi>83. Excommunicare nullo modo ad Suprematú Eccleſiae per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinet.</hi> To excommunicate doth no way belong to the Supremacie of the Church. And againe, pag. <hi>84. Omnes fatemur Regem excommunicandi poteſtarem nullam habere.</hi> Wee doe all confeſſe, that the King hath no power to excommunicate, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The later part of the former point affirmeth Ma. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,</hi> pag. <hi>137.</hi> when he ſaith: <hi>Quod Ambroſio licuit in Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſium, idem &amp; alijs in Regem ſimili de cauſa liceat, &amp;c.</hi> As it was lawfull for <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to proceed againſt <hi>Theodoſius;</hi> ſo is it lawfull alſo for others to proceed againſt the King, in the like cauſe, &amp;c. To wit (hee vvould ſay) as it was lawfull for S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> beeing a Biſhop, to excommunicate <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour; ſo in like manner it is lawfull for our Biſhops (of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) to excommunicate King <hi>Iames,</hi> if hee offend in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And then againe, pag. <hi>242. Supremus Eccleſiae Guber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator, poteſt eijci ex Eccleſia.</hi> The ſupreme Gouernor of the Church, (to wit, the King) may be caſt forth of the Church, &amp;c. And pag. <hi>267. Rex etſi iuſtuſimè excommunicatus, non a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittit Primatum.</hi> The King, although he ſhould be moſt inſtly excommunicated, yet hee doth not looſe his Primacie, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Now I doe not ſec, how theſe things can poſſibly hang to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or agree vvith thoſe vvhich hitherto before haue beene attributed to the King. For vnto him is attributed, That hee is primate, and the ſupreme head of the Church of England: That be is aboue all perſons, as well Eccleſiaſticall as temporall in his Kingdome: That hee bath ſupreme, moſt ample, and ful iuriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Eccleſiaſticall, no leſſe then politicall and temporall. And notwithstanding all this, beeing ſo great a perſon, yet can hee not exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate any one of his ſubiects, either Laicke, or Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, although neuer ſo rebellious and obſtinate. Nay, although hee be ſo great as hee is, hee may neuertheleſſe be excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his ſubiects, and caſt out of the Church of England, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:19639:113"/>he is ſupreame Head. I cannot vnderſtand this myſterie.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Heerevnto will I adde three arguments more, which will increaſe the difficultie. The firſt is: He that hath ſupreme, moſt ample, &amp; moſt full Iuriſdection Eccleſiaſticall in any Kingdom, may exerciſe all the actions, and offices that belong vnto Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction Eccleſiaſticall of that Kingdom. But now the King hath ſupreame, moſt ample, and moſt full Iuriſdiction Eccleſiasticall in the Kingdome of England, as Maiſter <hi>Tooker,</hi> and Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Salclebridge</hi> doe confeſſe: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he may exerciſe all offices belonging to Iuriſdiction Eccleſiasticall in the Kingdom of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: <hi>Ergo,</hi> be may alſo excommunicate: for that excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which is denounced by ſentence, is an act of Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction. Or elſe contrariwiſe, if you will thus: Hee that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exerciſe all acts of Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction in any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, hath not ſupreame, moſt ample, and moſt full Iuriſdiction Eccleſiaſticall in that Kingdome. But the King of England can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exerciſe all acts of Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdection in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, becauſe hee cannot excommunicate any man. <hi>Ergo,</hi> hee hath not ſupreme, moſt ample, and moſt full Iuriſdiction Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall in his Kingdome.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The ſecond argument is this. Hee that giueth to another, power to excommunicate, without doubt hath power himſelfe to excommunicate, becauſe no man can giue to another that which hee hath not himſelfe. But the King of England giueth power to his Biſhoppes to excommunicate. <hi>Ergo,</hi> hee hath power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate. The <hi>Minor</hi> is prooued out of Maiſter <hi>Tooker,</hi> pag. <hi>304.</hi> vvhere hee affirmeth, That the Biſhops (of England) doe receiue all their Eccleſiasticall Iuriſdiction of the exteriour Court, from the King. But now, power to excommunicate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to Iuriſdiction of the exteriour Court, as the Chaplaine pag. <hi>41.</hi> and Maiſter <hi>Tooker,</hi> pag. <hi>305.</hi> expreſly teach vs, ſaying: <hi>Rex habet omnem iuriſdictionem ſpiritualem in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro exteriori, exceptis quibuſdam cenſuris.</hi> The King hath all Iuriſdiction ſpirituall in the exteriour Court, excepting cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Cenſures. But now he excepteth Exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you ſee is to be noted againe a contradiction in Ma. <hi>Tooker;</hi> for that he referreth Cenſures (amongſt which excommunication
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:19639:114"/>is one) to the Iuriſdiction of the exteriour Court. True indeed. But yet he adioyneth two other things, that are contradictorie. The firſt, that the King can give vnto Biſhops all Iuriſdiction of the exteriour Court: and the ſecond, that the King hath not all Iuriſdiction of the exteriour Court.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The third A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gument is: That whoſoeuer is ſubiect to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in Eccleſiaſticall inriſdiction of the exteriour Court, hath not ſupreme, most ample, and full luriſdiction Eccleſiaſticall of the exteriour Court. But the King is ſubiect to ſome other body in Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction of the exteriour Court, to wit, to the Biſhop, becauſe he may by him be excommunicated, by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and caſt out of the Church, as Maiſter <hi>Burhill</hi> doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe: <hi>Ergo,</hi> hee hath not ſupreme, moſt ample, and moſt full Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction Eccleſiaſticall in the exteriour Court &amp;c. Or, if your will, contrariwiſe thus: Hee that is ſubiect to no other in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Iuriſdiction, cannot by any man be excommunicated by ſentence. But the King now, if he haue ſupreme Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction, is ſubiect to no other in Iuriſdiction Eccleſiasticall: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he cannot by any other be excommunicated &amp;c. I doube not, but you marke well, that theſe things doe not agree.</p>

               <p>IN good ſooth, by this precedent chapter, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue my Aduerlary a bad Diſputer; by the good leaue of his fellow Ieſuits. For manifeſting here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of let vs firſt handle the queſtion. You enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King may excommunicate his ſubiects.</p>
               <p>The worthy Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> pag. 151. Doctor <hi>Too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> pag. 15. Maiſter <hi>Thomſon,</hi> pag. 83. &amp; 84. affirme of all our Writers in theſe words, <hi>Omnes fatemur regem excommunicandipoteſtatem nullam habere: Wee all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that the King cannot excommunicate.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:19639:114"/>
               <p>I pray, tell me, in ſo full a concord, is heere any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference? Surely, no Engliſh Iarre, except a fained <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canicall</hi> Iarre: for the Ieſuite followeth not the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Whether the King can excommunicate; but, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King may be excommunicated, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth (as you ſee) to diſcourſe of the offices of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy: that is to ſay, Whether this be not numbred among the reſidue, <hi>That a Primate may be excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated of his ſubiects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here, like an idle Sophiſter, he fighteth without the liſts: and firſt, it is worth our labour, to marke his admirable skill in Logick, wherby he goeth about, out of our moſt vniforme conſent, to wreſt an Engliſh diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. This is therefore his firſt reaſon; <hi>The King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not execute all the inferiour actions of Eccleſiasticall iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>He cannot excommunicate: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath no ſupreame Eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am aſhamed of ſuch childiſh Ieſuiticall fancies. Is the Ieſuit become ignorant, or forgetfull of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion? Is not our controuerſie about one ſupreame Gouernour of the Church in all matters Eccleſiaſtical, and aboue all Eccleſiaſticall perſons? Yes, wee reaſon about the office of that one onely ſupreme Gouernor, as ſupreme Gouernour; according to Saint <hi>Auguſtine ad Bonifac:</hi> Epiſt. 50. <hi>Inhoc ergo ſeruiunt domino reges in quantum ſunt reges, cum eafaciunt ad ſeruiendum illi quae non poſſunt facere niſi reges. In this Kings ſerue the Lord, reſpecting onely their kingly office: that is, vvhen they doe thoſe things to ſerue him, which they cannot doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they vvere Kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſir, if excommunication belong onely to the primate or ſupreame Gouernour (for in our queſtion
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:19639:115"/>they are both one) then it ſhould follow, that all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and euery meane Archdeacon (for both theſe haue power to excommunicate) are alſo ſupreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of the Church: and ſo there muſt needs bee, by this Ieſuits Logick, as many onely ſupreme Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, as there bee Biſhoppes, and Archdeacons. Is any thing more abſurd? See you not in what a brake the Ieſuit is caught? But for the power of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, vnderſtand thus much; The King of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe can excommunicate no man: yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by the conſent of all the eſtates aſſembled in the Parliament, he can make Eccleſiaſticall lawes, by force and vertue wherof, this or that obſtinate ſubiect ought to be excommunicated.</p>
               <p>And beſides, it is in the Kings abſolute power, to commaund any Biſhoppe within his dominion, to abſolue any man, whom by appeale hee ſhall finde to be vniuſtly excommunicated.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Ieſuit reaſoneth thus: The King gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to other, power to excommunicate; therefore he he himſelfe may excommunicate. The Ieſuit might haue learned out of <hi>Bernard</hi> (whò they take for a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their owne) the vanitie and weakeneſſe of this argument: who, though his doctrine heerein be not orthodoxall, yet to infringe this conſequent, doth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry accuratly diſtinguiſh thus, writing to <hi>Eugenius; Conuerie gladium tuum in vaginam: Tuus ergo, et ipſe two forſitan nuiu, etſi non tua manu, cuaginandus, &amp;c. Put vp thy ſword into thy ſheath</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Peter</hi>). Then ſaith <hi>Bernard</hi> to the Pope, <hi>Yea, that ſword is thine, yet not to be drawn by thy hand, but at thy direction. Both ſwords are the Churches, that is to ſay, the ſpirituall ſword, and the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:19639:115"/>materiall ſword: but the materiall ſword is drawn for the Church; the ſpirituall ſword by the Church: one of them by the hand of a Priest; the other, by the hand of a Souldier: but yet, at the pleaſure of a Prieſt, and the commaund of the Emperour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, hee argueth on this manner; <hi>The King is ſubiect to the Biſhop excommunicating the King, as vvas</hi> Theodoſius <hi>to</hi> Ambroſe: <hi>therefore, hee is not the onelie ſupreme Gouernour in his dominion, ouer all perſons and cauſes Eccleſiasticall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I aunſwere, that if this be a ſtrong argument, then ſhall not the Pope be Primate of the Church: for the Pope is ſubiect to a Prieſt in his act of Confeſsion. So writeth <hi>Panormitan; Papatenetur confiteri:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Extra. de poenit. etre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs.</note> 
                  <hi>et in illo actu Sacerdos eſt maior illo: Sacerdos poteſt illum ligare et ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluere. The Pope himſelfe is bound to confeſſe to a Prieſt: and in that action, the Priest is greater then the Pope: for he hath power tobinde and looſe him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It alſo appeareth by a Councellat <hi>Conſtance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See the Councels of Couſtance and Baſil</note> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other at <hi>Baſil,</hi> that many Popes haue beene ſubiect to Biſhops, and by them conuented, iudged, excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, and depoſed from their Papacie: according to that of your Canon law; <hi>Cum again de fide,</hi>

               <p>The Ieſuit is deeply deceiued, if he imagine that the action of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was ſolemne and canonicall; or that it was excommunication in a ſtrict and proper ſenſe: which thing I will (when need requireth) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince by many ſolid arguments.

               <p>The Ieſuit beeing put vnto his ſhifts, hath fanſied this new ſtarting hole: viz.

               <p>Secondly, that the ancient Fathers deny this vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant excommunicating power to belong to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> (much leſſe to the Pope.) but with one vniforme
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:19639:117"/>conſent, dogmatize according to the Scriptures, that all the Apoſtles receiued from Chriſt immediatly (not from <hi>Peter</hi>) power to excommunicate, equall vvith <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the very principall Schoolemen, as <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> the Maiſter of the Sentences, <hi>Thomas Aquine,</hi> the Doctor Angelicall, <hi>Alexander Ales,</hi> the Doctorirrefragable, and <hi>Iohn Scot,</hi> the ſubrle Doctor, deny the ſame. Firſt, they all foure define the keyes, by the power to open and ſhut, to binde and looſe. See <hi>Lombard, Sent. l.</hi> 4. <hi>dist.</hi> 18. et 19. <hi>Alexander Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma Theolog. part.</hi> 4. <hi>q.</hi> 20. <hi>memb.</hi> 2. <hi>et</hi> 5. <hi>Aquin as in Sent. l.</hi> 4. <hi>diſt.</hi> 13 <hi>q.</hi> 1. <hi>art.</hi> 1. <hi>Scot. in Sent. l.</hi> 4. <hi>diſt.</hi> 19. <hi>art.</hi> 5.

               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe denieth this vndepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant power of excommunicating to be proper to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> and proueth by foure ſound arguments, the ſaid power to be common to all the Apoſtles, thus: <hi>de Ro. Pontif. l.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 23. <hi>That the Apoſtles receiued immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt their Iuriſdiction;</hi> Firſt, by theſe words of our Lord, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. <q>
                     <hi>As my Father ſent mee, ſo ſend I you.</hi> Which place, the Fathers, <hi>Chryſostome,</hi> &amp; <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophylact,</hi> ſo expound, that they ſay plainly, <hi>The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, by thoſe words, were made the Vicars of Chriſt: yea, and receiued the very office and authority of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyrill,</hi> vpon this place addeth, that <q>
                     <hi>The Apostles by theſe words, were properly created Apoſtles, and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the whole vvorld. And that wee ſhould vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:19639:118"/>ſtand, that all power Eccleſiasticall, is contayned in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie Apostolicall, therefore Christ addeth;</hi> As my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſent mee: <hi>ſeeing that the Father ſent his Sonne, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with chiefeſt, or higheſt power.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in his booke of the vnity of the Church, ſaith; <hi>The Lord ſpeaketh to</hi> Peter, <hi>I vvill giue thee the keyes of the Kingdome of Heauen,</hi> and after his reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſaid to him, <hi>Feed my Sheepe.</hi> And although after his reſurrection, he gaue <hi>to all the Apoſtles equall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſaid: As my Father ſent mee, ſo I ſend you;</hi> yet, <hi>to manifeſt vnitie, hee constituted one chayre.</hi> Where you ſee, the ſame to be giuen to the Apoſtles, by thoſe words, <hi>I ſend you;</hi> which was promiſed to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> by that, <hi>I will giue thee the keyes:</hi> and after, exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by that, <hi>Feed my ſheepe.</hi> Now it is manifeſt, that by thoſe words, <hi>I will giue thee the keyes,</hi> and by that, <hi>Feed my ſheepe,</hi> is vnderſtood the moſt full euen exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Iuriſdiction.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Secondly, the election of <hi>Matthias</hi> vnto the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtleſhip ſheweth the ſame. For, we read <hi>Acts.</hi> I. that <hi>Matthias</hi> was not choſen by the Apoſtles, nor any authoritie giuen vnto him; but that his election be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing craued and obtained from aboue, he was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly numbred among the Apoſtles. Surely, if all the Apoſtles had Iuriſdiction from <hi>Peter,</hi> that ought to haue been ſhewed moſt of all in <hi>Matthias.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thirdly, it is proued out of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely teacheth that hee had his authority and Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction from Chriſt; and thereupon, proueth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be a true Apoſtle. For, <hi>Gal.</hi> I. he ſaith, <hi>Paul an Apoſtle, not of men neither by man, but by Ieſus Chriſt, and G O D the Father.</hi> And, there to ſhew that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:19639:118"/>not authoritie from <hi>Peter,</hi> or other the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, hee ſaith; <hi>But when it pleaſed him, which had ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated mee from my mothers wombe, and called mee by his grace to reueale his Scnne in me, that I ſhould preach him among the Gentiles, immediatly I communicated not with fleſh and bloud, neither came I againe to Ieruſalem to the which were Apoſtles before mee: but I went into Arabia, and turned againe into Damaſcus. Then after 3. yeares, I came againe to Ieruſalem to ſee</hi> Peter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and chap. 2. <hi>For they that ſeemed to be ſomewhat, added nothing to me aboue that I had.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Fourthly, it is proued by cuident reaſon: for the Apoſtles were made onely by Chriſt, as it appeareth <hi>Luke 6. He called his Diſciples, &amp; choſe twelue of them, vvhom he alſo called Apostles.</hi> And <hi>Iohn 6. Haue not I choſen you twelue.</hi> Now that the Apoſtles had Iutiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, it is manifeſt, partly by the acts of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. did excommunicate, and 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.7. 11.14. &amp;c. made Canons. Partly alſo, becauſe the Apoſtolicall dignity, is the firſt, and ſupreme digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the Church: as it appeareth, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4. See B. <hi>Thomas,</hi> in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</q> Hitherto <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vnto theſe, I will adde the teſtimony of two other Fathers, to weet, <hi>Origen,</hi> and <hi>Beda. Origen,</hi> Tract 1. in <hi>Matth.</hi> ſaith: <hi>Hoc dictum, Tibi dabo claues regni coelorum, caeteris quoque co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune est: Et quae ſequuntur, velut ad Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum dicta. ſunt omnium communia. This ſaying, I vvill giue thee the keyes of the Kingdome of Heauen, is common to the rest of the Apoſtles: and the vvords that follow, as ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to Peter, are common vnto all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beda</hi> Homil. in Euangel. <hi>Quem me dicunt,</hi> ſaith; <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtas ligandi et ſoluendi quamuis ſoli Petro a Domino data

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> caeteris Apoſtolis, data eſt: The power of binding &amp; looſing, though it ſeeme to be giuen by the Lord onely to Peter, yet without all doubt, it was giuen alſo to the rest of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which, it is ſoundly prooued, that all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had <hi>the full power</hi> of the keyes, and moſt full Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction Eccleſiaſticall (and in one word) vndependant of any other, to binde, to looſe, to open, to ſhut, to excommunicate &amp; abſolue, giuen by Chriſt, equally &amp; immediatly vnto them, and their ſucceſſors, as well as to <hi>Peter</hi> and his ſucceſſors. But all Biſhops are ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors to the Apoſtles: therefore all Biſhops haue moſt full vndependant Iuriſdiction Eccleſiaſticall to exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate. And therefore, by this Ieſuits argument heere, all Biſhops are ſupreme Gouernors of the whole Church. What then ſhall become of his Lord God the Pope, and the Popes Primacie? Whoſe fulneſſe of power, muſt by this orthodoxall poſition, be diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted equally amongſt all Biſhops; not as from <hi>Peter</hi> or Pope, but as ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>For ſo <hi>Cyrill</hi> in <hi>Iohn,</hi> lib. 3. ca. 20. <hi>Apoſtolis et eorum in Eccleſijs ſucceſſoribus, plenam conceſsit poteſtate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Chriſt (not Peter, much leſſe the Pope) gaue to the Apoſtles, and their ſucceſſors, fulneſſe of power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where-to accordeth Saint <hi>Cyprian, de ſimpl. Praelat.</hi> ſaying: <hi>Christus candem dedit Apoſtolis omnibus pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatem: Chriſt gaue vnto all his Apoſtles the ſelfe ſame power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> to proue the Eccleſiaſticall authoritie of <hi>Matthias</hi> to be vndependant, and not dependant of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex,</hi> brings in <hi>Matthias</hi> choſen an Apoſtle, not by the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:19639:119"/>Apoſtles, but by God. And ſo of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> choſen an Apoſtle, not by men, nor of men, but of God. How then can the Pope challenge vndependant Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Iuriſdiction, when he is choſen and made Pope, &amp; alſo vnpoped by men, much inferiour to the Apoſtles? If the Pope alone haue vndependant Church gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to giue and take Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction, to, and from whom he pleaſe; how was the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> made equall vnto him in the firſt <hi>Nicen</hi> Councell, Can. 6? And why was the Archbiſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> equalled with him in authority, and in all things, except in Seniority; in the firſt Councell of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> cap. 3. and in the Councell of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> Can. 28?</p>
               <p>Certainly, this vndependant ſupreme gouernment, was not acknowledged to be in <hi>Anicetus</hi> Biſhoppe of <hi>Rome,</hi> by <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> who gain-ſaied <hi>Anicetus</hi> in the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of Eaſter. See <hi>Euſeb. l. 5. ca.</hi> 26. Nor in <hi>Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> who vſurping authoritie ouer the Biſhops of <hi>Aſia,</hi> was countermaunded, withſtood, and ſharply rebuked by <hi>Irenaeus, Polycrates,</hi> and others, Biſhops in <hi>France, Aſia, &amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Euſeb. l. 5. cap.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>Touching the Ieſuits argument, drawen from the Kings ſupreme gouermment ciuill, to conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by his power to exerciſe all acts pertaining to ciuill Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction. I reply and ſay, that true it is, the fountaine of all ciuill Iuſtice vnder God in this Kingdome, is in his Maieſtic: That hee alone hath power to conſtitute ciuill Iudges, and accordingly doth ſo. But our moſt learned Lawyers, and reuerent Iudges, will teach the Ieſuit, that when the Iudges be ſo conſtituted; by the lawes and cuſtomes of this kingdome, it pertaineth to
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:19639:120"/>thoſe Iudges, and not to his Maieſtie, to iudge &amp; ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, in matters perſonall, reall, or of blood, as Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and Treaſons, equally between the ſubiects, and alſo betweene the King &amp; his lubiects: which cuts in ſunder the very hart-ſtrings of this his main argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For, if it pertaine not to the King, to exerciſe all acts of inferiour ciuill gouernment, though hee be the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme ciuill Gouernour in his Kingdome; <hi>a fortiori</hi> it followeth, that it pertaineth not to his Maieſtie, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe all inferiour acts of Eccleſia ſticall gouernment, though hee be ſupreme Eccleſiaſticall Gouernor.</p>
               <p>The Lord of a Manour, to which belongeth a Court Baron, may conſtitute a Steward to haue Iuriſdiction ouer his Tenants in that Court, in ſetting fynes, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercing, &amp;c. yet the Lord of the Manour cannot exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute that Iuriſdiction: for if hee ſet fynes, or amerce, it is voide; though that Court be, and is alſo called, that Lords Court.</p>

               <p>Touching the ſuppoſed Iarre betweene <hi>Hainric</hi> &amp; mee: <hi>Hainric,</hi> writing generally of the power of all Chriſtian Kings and Emperours, to make Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call lawes, aſſerted that the ſaid Kings and Emperours, laudably by their owne power, made ſuch lawes: which I alſo auerre.

So this ſeeming Iarte, in the view of the goggle

               <p>Further I reply, that Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> of bleſſed memory, by her own authority, ſet forth Iniunctions, as Eccleſiaſticall lawes.

               <p>TO an vnlearned Ieſuit, plaine vulgar things ſeeme Paradoxes. Date the Ieſuit deny, that Clergie men haue power to make lawes for putting to death of Hereticks, and againſt ſuch &amp; ſuch erroncous obſtinate perſons as hereticks? and dare he affirme, that Clergy men may giue the ſentence of death, or ſhed the bloud of any heretick; ſith by their triuiall, and vulgarly known popiſh Canon, they may not ſit vpon the bench when the ſentence of death is pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced by the ciuil Iudges? That moſt certain rule of his Lawyers, is moſt plainly falſe. viz. That whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer hath power to make a penall law, hath power to puniſh: vnleſſe the meaning be of power to puniſh, by commaunding ſuch Officers to puniſh, vnto whom the inflicting of ſuch puniſhment appertaineth. In which ſenſe, our King alſo may be ſaid to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, or abſolue: that is, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand Biſhops to exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The King giues vnto another power to excommunicate; therefore himſelfe hath power to excommunicate: or if he haue not that power, he cannot giue it to another. You deny the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, alleaging <hi>Bernard</hi> to ſhew the invalidity thereof. But <hi>Bernard</hi> rather hindereth, then helpeth your cauſe: for he reaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noth as I doe, thus: <hi>Peter</hi> had no temporall poſſeſſions; therefore he could not giue them to another. Hee had care of the vvhole Church; therefore he gaue it to his ſucceſſor. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this conſequent, but of a double power of the Pope; the one, temporall indirectly; all offices of which power, <hi>Bernard</hi> deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Pope by himſelfe way execute: the other, his power ſpirituall directly, vvhich hee granteth may be executed by the Pope himſelfe. This Poſition, viz. No man can giue to another, that which hee hath not himſelfe, <hi>Bernard</hi> and I aſſert: to which you anſwere nothing.</p>

               <p>THe Ieſuit is heere enſnarled by the teſtimony of <hi>Bernard,</hi> as one fallen into a quagmire; who the more hee ſtruggleth to get out, plungeth himſelfe deeper into it. <hi>Bernard</hi> aſſerteth <hi>the right and power of both ſwords, equally to be in the Pope,</hi> (for that, of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:19639:122"/>Directly, and Indirectly, is not <hi>Bernards</hi> diſtinction, but the Ieſuits vaine and new found fiction) <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be may giue power to others,</hi> ad nutum ipſius, <hi>to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Materiall ſword: yet by himſelfe cannot vſe, or draw out the ſame.</hi> What is this elſe, but that one may giue power to another, to doe that which hee cannot doe himſelfe?</p>
               <p>The Ieſuit is intolerably ignorant, if he know not, that by their Canon law, the Pope is made <hi>Lord of the whole vvorld</hi> in temporalibus: <hi>by vvhom Kings raigne, and of vvhom they hold their Scepters.</hi> In popiſh books printed and allowed, They who hold the materiall ſword to be in the Pope, not <hi>directlie,</hi> but <hi>indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,</hi> are cenſured for <hi>Politilian Hereticks, theſe times-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what if I ſhould vſe the ſame diſtinction heere, and ſay, that ſupreme Iuriſdiction Eccleſiaſticall, were it the King indirectly, to weet, <hi>in or dine ad cuſtodiam v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triuſque tabulae;</hi> to pronide and procure, that all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticks performe their duties, according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of Gods law: Were not this Ieſuits Argument, according to his owne diſpute heere, daſht in peeces? For, as the Pope may haue the materiall ſword indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, and yet haue no power by himſelfe to vſe the ſame: ſo may a King haue ſupreame Iuriſdiction Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall indirectlie; and yet not haue power by himſelfe to execute the functions of Iuriſdiction Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eleſiaſticall; and ſo not to excommunicate. True it is, No man can giue that vnto another, which himſelfe hath not to giue: yet the King may giue authoritie to another, to doe that, which pertaines not to himſelfe to doe, as formerly was ſhewed.</p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:19639:123"/>
               <p>This is a decided caſe amongſt the Canoniſts, <hi>Deciſ. 2. Tit. de Praebend. Quia licet Abbatiſſae aut Moniali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus cur a committi non poſsit, quoad exercitium actuale, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menius poteſt ipſis competere, vtexercitium faciant per vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum illius poteſtatis capacem.

               <p>But it is not amiſs to obſerue ſome concluſions from the Ieſuits Poſitions heere.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the Popes ſupreme power Eccleſiaſticall, is dependant vpon another, that is, vpon <hi>Peter.</hi> For he aſſerteth out of <hi>Bernard, That</hi> (not Chriſt, but) <hi>Peter gaue vnto the Pope, the cure of the vvhole Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that the Pope, as <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor, neither hath, nor can giue, any temporall poſſeſsions. For ſo he makes <hi>Bernard</hi> concluding thus: <hi>Peter had no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall poſſeſsions himſelfe: therefore he could give no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall poſſeſsions to his ſucceſſor the Pope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, That a man may giue that to another, which hee hath not himſelfe. For the Pope, as <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor, giues temporall Kingdoms &amp; Empires: and yet the Pope, as <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor, hath no temporall poſſelsions, much leſſe Kingdoms, and leaſt of all, Empires.</p>

            <p>MY third Argument was this: Hee that is ſubiect to another in Iuriſdiction Eccleſiaſticall of exteriour Court, hath not ſupreme Iuriſdiction Eccleſiaſticall of exteriour Court.</p>
            <p>But the King is ſubiect to another, that is, the Biſhop, vvho by Iuriſdiction Eccleſiaſticall of exteriour Court, may excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate him, and throwe him out of the Church. Therfore he hath not ſupreme power Eccleſiaſticall of exteriour Court.</p>
            <p>Your anſwere vvas, That ſo the Pope is not Primat of the Church; for hee is ſubiect to the Prieſt, to whom bee confeſſeth, and vvho may binde and looſe his ſinnes. The Primacy doth not conſiſt in Iuriſdiction of the interiour, but exteriour Court. The power of abſoluing from ſinnes, or the inward Iuriſdiction, is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by Chriſt immediatly, to all Prieſts equally, by force of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: vvhich Iuriſdiction is not greater in the Pope, then in any other Prieſt.

               <p>IT ſeemeth the wits of this Ieſuit are much wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted; for he knowes not the way wherein, or the place whereto, hee intendeth to goe.</p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:19639:124"/>
               <p>Amongſt vs Writers, who all deny the King hath power to excommunicate, hee ſaid there was a great Iarre; becauſe vvee alſo held the King to be ſupreame Eccleſiaſticall Gouernour in his dominions. By which <hi>Medium,</hi> viz. <hi>The Kings ſupremacie,</hi> ſuppoſed to be true; the Ieſuit endeuoured to inferre neceſſarily, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King might excommunicate.</p>
               <p>But in this his third Syllogiſme, the Ieſuit goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ouerthrowe the ſuppoſed truth of the ſaid <hi>Medium:</hi> namely, to proue, that the King is not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Gouernour Eccleſiaſticall. And what is this to the matter in hand? viz. to proue a Iarre? VVhich anſwere is more ſufficient, then his fondneſſe deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth. Yet, becauſe, hee imagineth this Syllogiſme to be invincible, I will anſwere directly vnto it, &amp; ſhiuer it all to naught.</p>
               <p>I deny both the <hi>Maior</hi> and <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. I ſay, The <hi>Maior</hi> is falſe, &amp; ſhew it thus; The Pope is ſubiect to other Biſhops, who, in exteriour Court, that is, in Councells, haue not onely excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (whereof ſee <hi>Sozom. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. <hi>Nicephor. lib.</hi> 17. <hi>cap.</hi> 26. <hi>Concil. Constantinopol.</hi> 6. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo anathematized him. Yet ſaith this Ieſuit, The Pope <hi>in Court exteriour, is ſupreame Gouernour o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all Biſhoppes, to vvhom hee giueth, and from vvhom hee taketh away at his pleaſure, power to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, The Pope is ſubiect to a Prieſt, his Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, vvho hath power to exerciſe the keyes againſt the Pope, viz. to open vnto him heauen gates, and to ſhut them againſt him. To binde his ſinnes, and to looſe them. To throwe him out of that communion of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:19639:124"/>Saints, whereof wee read in the Creede. To deliuer him to Sathan: and therfore to excommunicate him.</p>
               <p>The Ieſuits ſtarting hole heere is, That the Prieſt may binde the Popes ſinnes in the <hi>internall</hi> Court, but not in the <hi>externall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As though the Court of Conſcience, were not the higheſt Court vnder Heauen. As though that Communion which ſtands onelie of Saints indeede, and all thoſe Gods Elect, vvere not aboue that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which conſiſteth of holy ones, and vnholie: of the Elected and Reprobated. For, as by popiſh Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, The Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction is aboue the Temporall: ſo the Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi> is aboue the <hi>externall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If therefore the Prieſt Confeſſour bee aboue the Pope, vvhoſe ſinnes hee bindeth; vvhom hee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth to Sathan; vvhom hee excommunicateth from that inward Communion of Saints Elect, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his <hi>invvard</hi> Iuriſdiction; vvhy may hee not much more excommunicate him from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the righteous and vnrighteous, the Elect and Reprobate, by externall Iuriſdiction, vvhich is farre inferiour to the other?</p>
               <p>But becauſe the Ieſuit heere taxeth mee, for not diſtinguiſhing betweene Iuriſdiction <hi>internall,</hi> and <hi>externall;</hi> between the binding of ſinnes in Court <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour</hi> and <hi>interiour,</hi> I anſwere him, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> did to another Heretick: <hi>Ostendat Hermogenes ſcriptum, aut vae illi. Let</hi> Becan <hi>ſhevv vvhere this distinction is vvritten, or vvoebe vnto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If he cannot, then let him heare, what the Church of England in her <hi>Apologie,</hi> the ſecond part, chap. 7.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:19639:125"/>
                  <hi>Diuiſ.</hi> 5. hath orthodoxally, and iudiciouſly determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned heerein: viz. <hi>Seeing one manner of vvord is giuen to all, and one onely key belongeth vnto all, we ſay there is but one onely power of all Ministers, as concerning opening and ſhutting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that if the Prieſt by this one key ſhutte out the Pope, that is, binde his ſinnes, then he excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Pope: or if with that ſelfe-ſame key, hee open to the Pope, that is, remit his ſinne; then heab ſolueth the Pope. For wherefore is one excommunicated, but becauſe his ſinnes are bound? wherefore is one abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but becauſe his ſinnes are remitted? If it bee not in reſpect thereof, the King may be ſaid to haue power to exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate; that is to ſay, to keep men from the Communion, viz. when he committeth ſome to cloſe priſon: where, neither any can ſpeake to them, nor they to any.</p>
               <p>Now therefore, if the Prieſt may be the cauſe of the cauſe, that is, if hee can binde the Popes ſinnes; vvhy may he not be the cauſe of the effect: that is, why may he not excommunicate the Pope; or, (which with S. <hi>Paul</hi> is all one) deliuer him to Sathan? According to that of Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> to <hi>Heliodore,</hi> of the Eremiticall life: <q>
                     <hi>God for bid that I ſhould ſpeak any euill of thoſe, who ſucceeding the Apoſtolike degree, make the body of Chriſt vvith their ſacred mouth: vvho hauing the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, in ſort iudge before the day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is not lawfull for mee to ſit before a Prieſt: hee may, if I ſinne, deliuer mee to Sathan for the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the Spirit may be ſaued.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo Saint <hi>Raſil</hi> of the ſolitarie life, cha. 23. <hi>Peter,</hi> inquit, <hi>Amas me, &amp;c. Chriſt ſaid vnto Peter, Loueſt thou
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:19639:125"/>mee?</hi> Feed my ſheep. <hi>And in like ſort vnto all Paſtors and Doctors hee gaue the ſame power. A token vvhereof is this, that all binde and looſe equally, as vvell as Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If euery Paſtor and Doctor binde and looſe equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as well as <hi>Peter;</hi> vvhy not in Court exteriour as well as <hi>Peter,</hi> ſith the ſheep are committed vnto them, as well as vnto <hi>Peter?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition I alſo deny heere, as I did in the <hi>Engliſh Concord.</hi> That is, I deny that any Biſhoppe hath power to throwe the King out of the Church, or to excommunicate him, according to canonicall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, ſo properly called and defined.</p>
               <p>And further I denied, that the ſuppoſed excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> by <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> was canonicall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication: yeelding there ſome reaſons thereof.

Maiſter <hi>Salclebridge</hi> ſaith be is, pag. 163. in theſe vvords: <hi>Sic luce clarius eſt, Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos Principes cum laude, Controuerſias fidei dijudicaſſe &amp; diremiſſe, etiam in vniuerſalibus octo Concilijs, &amp;c.</hi> So as it is more cleare then the Sunne, that Chriſtian Princes, vvith praiſe, haue iudged of, and decided controuerſies of faith, and that in eight Generall Councells &amp;c.

All theſe Controuerſies, ſaith Maiſter <hi>Saclebridge,</hi> were iudged of, and decided by Kings and Emperours.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Maiſter <hi>Tooker</hi> now, hee affirmeth the quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, vvho by no meanes vvill haue Kings or Emperours to bee Iudges of Controuerſies of faith.

            <p n="3">3. So as, if now in England there ſhould chaunce to ariſe a diſſenſion or debate concerning any point of Faith or Religion,

Firſt, when hee bluſheth not to write, that <hi>Hainric</hi> affirmeth, the King, by vertue of his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie, is ſupreme Iudge of all controuerſies; when on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, he deemeth no mortall man, nor King, nor Angel, can be that ſupreme Iudge: nor Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> according to that, <hi>It ſeemed good vnto the holy Ghoſt and to vs:</hi> and leaſt of all, the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, hee conſtantly denieth, that any one of the Fathers euer numbred this dignity, of beeing ſupreme Iudge of controuerſies, among the other duties of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of the Church, or Eccleſiaſticall ſupremacie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though <hi>Becan</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hic vhique diſsidium,</hi> nothing but iarring: yet in good ſooth, [that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes haue with commendation iudged &amp; taken vp controuerſies of faith; out of theſe words of <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, Lib. 5. cap. 10.</hi> Theodoſius <hi>called together a Councell of all Sects: and vvhen the Emperour vnderſtood their manifold diſſenſions, hee commaunded them, that euery of their Sects ſhould put in vvriting the particular articles of their ſeuerall faith. They put their opinions in vvriting accordingly. Then, when they vvere ſent for to the Court, the Biſhoppes of each Sect appeared and met together: the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:19639:127"/>Emperour taketh at their hands the vvritten ſcroules of their faith. Afterward, he ſhutteth vp himſelfe in his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet alone, and moſt earneſtly maketh prayer to GOD, that his Maiestie vvould helpe him to finde out the truth. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hee readeth euery confeſsion ſeuerally, and hauing read them, be condemneth and teareth them all, except the faith of the</hi> Conſubſtantiall: <hi>that hee praiſed and approoued</hi>] not onely <hi>Hainric,</hi> but before him, Ma. Doctor <hi>Bilſon</hi> the moſt graue &amp; learned Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> in his book of <hi>Christian obedience,</hi> printed at London, <hi>Anno</hi> 1586. and before him, that moſt excellently learned <hi>Iuell,</hi> Bb. of <hi>Salisbury,</hi>

The Emperour Theodoſius (as Socrates vvriteth) did not onely ſit among the Biſhops, but was alſo chiefe at the deciſion of the controuerſie, and did rend in peeces the vvritings of the Haereticks, approouing the faith of the true profeſsing Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which <hi>Hainric</hi> writeth heere of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies of faith, remembred by the Ieſuit in the foure firſt generall Councells (as for the ſecond Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> it was rather a godleſſe and trifling conſpiracy then a Councell) wherein Emperours ſate Preſidents, and together with the conſent of the Synod, gaue iudgements, and concluded thoſe differences; that did alſo Biſhop <hi>Iuell,</hi> write long before him, <hi>Part. b. cap.</hi> 13. <hi>b.</hi> 1. <hi>Pag.</hi> 522. out of Cardinall <hi>Cuſanus,</hi> in his third booke <hi>De Concordia, cap.</hi> 16. whom we will ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner belieue, then tenne thouſand <hi>Becans:</hi> the words are
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:19639:128"/>theſe; <hi>Sciendum est quod in vniuerſalibus octo concilys ſemper invenio Imperatores, &amp;c. This you must knowe, that in the firſt eight generall Councells, I alwaies find, that the Emperours, and their ſubſtitutes, with the Senate, had the ſupremacie and office of Preſidentſhip: and vvith the conſent of the Synode, gaue the iudgements and deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now Sir, I pray you, what other thing is this, then to iudge and take vp controuerſies of faith? and yet the Ieſuit turnes Ieſter in this ſo ſerious a matter; as if the gods of his ſocietie had giuen him ſome great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage: ſaying vpon his former weake inferences; <hi>So as if in England there ſhould chaunce to ariſe a debate, &amp;c.</hi> And I will follow his ſteppes, and turne his owne tearms vpon him in this manner:</p>
               <p>So as if in <hi>Rome</hi> there ſhould chaunce to ariſe a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſion, or debate about any point of faith; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, about the Popes ſupremacie, or (which is all one) his beeing vniuerſall Biſhoppe, what would the Academicall Fathers of the ſocietie of IESVS doe? vvho haue ſuppreſſed the Sorboniſts. What would the people of <hi>Rome</hi> doe, or other the Popes ſubiects? Should they goe to Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fift, as their onelle Iudge and deſire his ſentence &amp; determination? why then Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the great (a farre wiſer man) vvill ſtand againſt it. Should they goe and deſire any other Iudge to take vp the matter? Surely, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> wil not endure that.</p>
               <p>What were then beſt to be done in this caſe? Euen that which hither to hath beene done in the debate of the Popes ſupremacy. For the Papiſts haue euer beene at odds, and iarred, and could neuer end this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:19639:128"/>And what's the cauſe? In very deed no other, but for that ſome thinke one thing, and ſome another: and they cannot, or rather will not, finde out the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and true Iudge, who can decide the matter. And this is the property of hereticks.</p>
               <p>Againe, I will touch <hi>Becane</hi> in one inſtance, more neerely. If there chaunce to ariſe a controuerſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this point, or article of the Popes religion; <hi>An ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des haereticis ſeruanda,</hi> Whether promiſe muſt be kept with hereticks, what will the Academicall Fathers of the ſocietie doe? Will they goe to Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fift? <hi>Becane</hi> will not like of that. Will they goe to any other Iudge? <hi>Barronius</hi> will not endure it; no, nor <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> the Syre of all the Ieſuits (who firſt inuented the Art of Equiuocation, and ſo the breach of faith) if hee were aliue.</p>
               <p>Heere I might boinfinite: but I will confine my ſelfe in one or two examples. If it chance a diſſenſion or debate to ariſe about the body of Chriſt in the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt;</hi> as whether it may be broken, or chewed with the teeth of them that care it; according to the Decree <hi>Part. 3. dist. 2. cap.</hi> 42. What would the <hi>Romane</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks doe in this caſe?</p>
               <p>Would they repaire to Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fiſt, as Iudge of this controuerſie? <hi>Berengarius</hi> in his Recantation hath giuen warning to the contrary. Would they goe to Pope <hi>Nicholas? Bellarmine</hi> will not allow of him; vvho in his third booke and tenth chapter of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> vvriteth; <hi>Christus vere in Sacramento existit, ſed non teritur, non roditur: Christ is trulie in the Sacrament, but hee is neither bitten nor chewed.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:19639:129"/>
               <p>To conclude, if there ariſe a diſſenſion at <hi>Rome,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Reall preſence;</hi> as for example, Whether Chriſts body be really preſent, but without <hi>bigneſſe,</hi> as <hi>Durand</hi> holdeth, in 4. <hi>Diſt</hi> 10. <hi>q.</hi> 2. or with <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> but <hi>vvithout diſtinction of parts,</hi> as <hi>Decam in 4. q.</hi> 4. and thirdly, with <hi>bigneſſe,</hi> and <hi>all diſtinct parts,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine, Lib. 3. cap. 5. De Euchar.</hi> what were then beſt to be done in this caſe? For the Papiſts are alwaies at odds &amp; iarre about the corporall preſence of Chriſt in the <hi>Euchariſt:</hi> and the ſtrife can neuer be taken vp. What's the cauſe? In very deede no other, but for that ſome thinke one thing, and ſome another: and they cannot, or rather will not, finde out the certaine and true Iudge, who can decide the matter. And this is the property of Hereticks.</p>
               <p>But heere obſerue with mee in the laſt place, the guilefull diſpoſition of <hi>Becan;</hi> Doctor <hi>Tooker,</hi> pag. 23. affirmeth, that Princes are <hi>aboue the perſons,</hi> and <hi>not the ſacred things,</hi> as the <hi>vvord, Sacraments,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all graces of the Church:</hi> adding in the ſame page, <hi>Sole ipſo, &amp;c I vvill make it as cleare as the Sunne, that the chiefe care of the Prince, must be had for things and cauſes Eccleſiasticall: and that their ſupremacy eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in the execution of that function.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence the Ieſuit maketh this collection; The King (by confeſsion of Doctor <hi>Tocker</hi>) is not aboue ſome Eccleſiaſticall things, as the <hi>vvord,</hi> and <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi> therefore aboue no Eccleſiaſticall things, as are the controuerſies of Biſhops; Againſt Doctor <hi>Tooker</hi> his expreſſe meaning in the ſame leafe.</p>

               <p>So that euery Chriſtian is to reſt, <hi>not in his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per iudgement,</hi> for that is vncertaine; but in the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine iudgement of the forſaid <hi>annointing:</hi> working in the Saints that <hi>certaine knowledge, vvherein to place the foundation of their faith;</hi> vvhereof his Maieſtie ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.</p>

                  <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, and firſt Chriſtian Emperor, found in himſelfe, by gracious effect, the certainty of this ſaid doctrine, heere averred by our King; for thus hee writeth in his Epiſtle to <hi>Sapor,</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> regiſtred by <hi>Theodoret,</hi> Lib. 1. cap. 24. <hi>Marking the diuine faith, I obtaine the light of truth: and following the light of trueth, I acknowledge the diuine faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The certaine truth of this doctrine, is ſo apparant, that is bath expreſſe teſtimony and acknowledgement

               </p>
               <p>Therfore, I will here inſtance in one onely, and that no meane one, viz. <hi>Stapleton,</hi> who in his ſecond admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition to Maiſter D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Whitakers,</hi> ſet before his <hi>Triplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> writeth thus: <hi>In libro meo</hi> 3. <hi>Principior ŭ fidei, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus ſancti internam perſuaſionem, ad quodlibet fidei ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectum credendum, ita neceſſariam, ita efficacem eſſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cui, vt nec abſque illa, quicquam a quoquam creds poſsit, et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi milliei Eccleſia atteſtetur: et per illam ſolam quodlibet credendum credi queat, tacente prorſus, et non audita Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia. In my</hi> 8. <hi>booke of the Principles of faith, I have taught, that the invvard perſuaſion of the holy Ghoſt is ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and ſo effectuall for the belieuing of euery obiect of faith, that vvithout it, neither can any thing bee belieued by any man, though the Church testified vvith it a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times; and by it alone any thing that is to be belieued, may be belieued, though the Church kept ſilence, and never vvere heard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is not the force of this truth great, and muſt needs preuaile, ſith the Aduerſaries themſelues, write ſo fully and directly for it?</p>
               <p>To ſhut vp this point, and to ſhut the Pope cleane out, from this <hi>ſupreme Iudgeſhip, Panormitan</hi> the Abbat, in <hi>De</hi> Elect. <hi>et Elect potest. ca.

And yet further in the ſame place: <hi>Rex Ethnicus, cum Chriſto initiatur, non acquirit Primatú de nouo.</hi> An Ethnicke King (ſaith hee) vvhen as hee is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in Chriſt, or the Chriſtian faith, doth not purchaſe any new primacie, &amp;c.

            <p n="2">2.

His vvords are theſe: <hi>An non Regi Ethnico praeſtare fidem fas? Imo nefas non praeſtare.

               <p>IN this place, either the Ieſuit is beſide himſelfe, or elſe hee hath much forgot himſelfe. For euery where in his other Queſtions, hee affir meth that no King; either Pagan or Chriſtian, hath any Primacy in the Church: and yet heere, hee enquireth from whence, and by what title, hee hath his Primacie in the Church. Therefore, by his owne learning, hee beateth his braines to find the originall of nothing.</p>
               <p>If he take away this ſuppoſition, that the King hath a Primacie in the Church, either preciſely as hee is a King, or elſe, becauſe hee is a Chriſtian King; hee is a fooliſh Sophiſter.

               <p>If hee let that ſuppoſition ſtand; then, becauſe it is manifeſt, that our moſt gracious King <hi>Iames,</hi> is by birth, a King: and by religion a Chriſtian King; he is a brainſick wrangler. For, ſith by his ſuppoſall heere, The King hath the Primacie of the Church: vvhat matter is it, whether he haue it, as hee is a King, or as hee is a Chriſtian King, if ſo bee he haue it at all?</p>
               <p>Wherefore, there is no cauſe that we ſhould much ſtand vpon this idle and beggerly queſtion, wherein is onely a ſhadow of a queſtion.</p>
               <p>Furhermore, I would haue the Ieſuit vnderſtand, that this Primacie of the Church hee ſtandeth vpon, is not deriued from the title of a King, but from God himſelfe. For <hi>Moſes</hi> was adorned with this dignitie in the Church of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And yet we neuer read, that hee was ſtiled with the title of a King.</p>
               <p>But certainly, that you may knowe heere is no iarre or odds among vs, reſpecting the maine: the worthy Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> in his <hi>Tortura,</hi> pag. 377. hath ſoundly, and according to the very truth manifeſted, That the Primacie of the Church, belongeth not to Ethnicke Kings, as Ethnick: but vnto Kings, as they are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kings, or Defenders of the Diuine truth. His words are theſe; <q>

And thoſe things before related out of the old Testament, are ſo ſolid and ſubstantiall grounds, as</hi> Tortus <hi>ſhall neuer bee able to ſhake.

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:19639:136"/>giue no more vnto ſuch Princes, then vvas giuen in the old vnto</hi> Ahaſucrus, <hi>and</hi> Nabuchodonoſor. <hi>Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in this point,</hi> Tortus <hi>is beſide himſelfe: but yet, if</hi> Caeſar <hi>become a Chriſtian, as in</hi> Conſtantine, <hi>then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he hath the ſame right ouer the Church of the new Testament, vvhich</hi> Ioſias <hi>had in the old.</hi> Reditus ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim fit ad iura regum Iſrael; <hi>there is a preſent poſſeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ancient rights of the Kings of Iſrael, as ſoone as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they are made Kings of the Iſrael of God, &amp; giuen vp their names to Christ. Wherefore, this is not our purpoſe, that the Perſecuters of the Church, ſuch as vvere</hi> Cains <hi>and</hi> Tiberius, <hi>ſhould be the Gouernours of the Church, (vvho would not receiue that title although a man would giue it them: becauſe they employ their vvhole ſtrength to ruine and roote vp the Church): but let them then take ſuperiority in the Church, vvhen they are vnfainedlie converted to the faith thereof.

               <p>Theſe things ſo expreſſed, are very true and fitting our purpoſe: for in them we haue learned, that Pagan Kings, as they are Pagans, haue no Primacie in the Church.</p>
               <p>But what if almighty God ſo guide and gouern the hearts of Pagan Kings, as that they would ſtand for the worſhip of God againſt error, and make lawes for the ſame; let the Ieſuit tell mee in that caſe, vvhether God doth not <hi>hinde our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience to obey</hi> pagan Princes?

               <p>Andaccording to this ſentence, wrote Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> many yeares before him, in his 50. Epiſt. to <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facius</hi> the Souldiour. <q>

But now is the propheticall Oracle fulfilled, vvhich ſpeaketh in the</hi> 2. Pſalm, Now, ô yce Kings, ſerue the Lord in feare. <hi>And how ſhall Kings ſcrue the Lord in feare, vnleſſe they prohibite and puniſh thoſe enormities with religious ſeueritie and iuſtice, vvhich are daily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt the Lords will and commaundement? And
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:19639:137"/>becauſe hee is a King, he ſerueth (as a ſeruant) by making Lawes, vvith force and vigour to commaund things that are righteous, and to forbid the contrarie. Euen as</hi> Ezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>ſerued by destroying the Temples of Idols, and cutting downe the groues. Euen as King</hi> loſias <hi>ſerued, by dooing the like. Euen as the King of</hi> Niniuch <hi>ſerued, by compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the vvhole Citie to pacifie the Lord. Euen as King</hi> Darius <hi>ſerued, by breaking the Idol in pecces. Euen as King</hi> Nabuchodonoſor <hi>ſerued, by making a godly and laudable lawe, that vvhoſoeuer blaſphemed the God of</hi> Sydrach, <hi>hee ſhould be deſtroyed, and his houſe razed. In this therefore Kings ſerue the Lord, in that they are Kings; vvhen they doe thoſe things for his ſeruice, which they cannot doe but as they are Kings.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>If therefore the Ieſuit, had ſeriouſly knowen how to diſtinguiſh theſe things, hee might haue acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that Maiſter <hi>Burhill,</hi> and Maiſter <hi>Thomſon,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with the reuerend Biſhop in this point.

All Kings, yea, very Pagan Kings (objectiuely) haue ſupreme power ouer all the perſons of their ſubiects, both in ſacred and ciuill things:</hi> eſpecially, to <hi>attemper their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and permit their exerciſe: vvhich thing is witneſſed by the Chronicles of all Nations. Although the Pagans v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that their power against the Lord: yet vvas it a fault of the men, abuſing their power giuen them of God to a good end, and not any fault of the power at all. But yet, by a farre more ſpeciall regard did this power in Eccleſiaſticall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, of old belong to the good Kings of Iſraell: and now alſo to Christian Princes.</hi> For <hi>they, as bceing of the lewiſh Synagogue, and theſe, as beeing of the Church, haue a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:19639:138"/>and more ſpeciall right in all cauſes of the Church, then if they were meerely and onely Kings. Wherefore, in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect it was ſaid to</hi> Cyrus; Paſtor incusestu: <hi>Thou art my Shepheard: and in another reſpect to</hi> Dauid: Tu paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces populum meum Iſrael; <hi>Thou ſhalt feed my people Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.

               <p>And ſpeaking to <hi>Becan</hi> himſelfe, pag. 94. hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth with theſe words; <hi>Haec facilia ſunt intellectu: &amp; miror te tantum Theologum hic haeſiſſe.

Thus he reaſoneth out of Maiſter <hi>Thomſons,</hi> and Maiſter <hi>Burhills</hi> opinion. All Kings, yea popiſh and pagan, haue a primacy in their Kingdoms: <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſaith the Ieſuit, it muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that all perſons liuing in thoſe Kingdoms, are bound to doe all things (though neuer ſo vvicked) which are by them commaunded. Is this the Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Ieſuits?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 23. 2. Our Sauiour ſpeaketh thus to his Diſciples; <hi>The Scribes and Phariſees ſit in Moſes chaire: all things therefore vvhich they commaund you to doe, that obſerue and doe. Acts</hi> 4.18.

But <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them other wiſe; <hi>Whether it be more iust, vvee obey GOD, or man: iudge yee.</hi> And after this manner writeth <hi>Iſidore</hi> in the Canon law, <hi>Si is qui praeeſt,</hi> 11. <hi>q.</hi> 3. out of <hi>Baſil; St is qui praeest prohibet vobis quod a Domino est proeceptum, &amp;c.

               <p>The Romane Catholiques of <hi>Venice,</hi> of <hi>Sorbona,</hi> &amp; many other Noble-menan <hi>France,</hi> acknowledge the Popes <hi>ſupremacy</hi> in the church: but if the Pope ſhould commaund them to become his ſubiects in temporall things, <hi>etiam in ordine ad ſpiritualia,</hi> in <hi>behalfe of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all cauſes:</hi> or, if hee ſhould authoriſe the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and commaund them to follow it; would they, thinke you, obey his vvill?

               </p>
               <p>I will beate you with the ſcourge of your owne tongue; <hi>Perhaps they vvill aunſwere, They vvill obey vvhen they thinke good.

               <p>Now, for his plaineneſſe, or plaine ignorance; theſe are the words of the Biſhoppe of <hi>Ely,</hi> in <hi>Tortura Torti,</hi> pag. 39. <hi>Dominia non fundantur in fide, ſic infidelitate non euertuntur. Quin rex quinis cum de Ethnice Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus fit, non perdit ius terrenum, ſed acquirit nouum. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernments and principalities are not founded vpon belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and therefore are not ouerthrowne by infidelitie. But vvhen any King is made a Chriſtian, of a Pagan, hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not the earthly right he had before, but acquireth a new right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus farre our vvorthy Biſhoppe. Now (ſaith the Iefait) in theſe words, The Chaplaine teacheth, that Pagan Kings haue no Primacie in the Church; but they receiue it by their conuerſion to Chriſtianitie. But I ſay, that theſe are not the words of the Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> onely, but (before him) of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine, De Roman: Pont: Lib 5. cap. 2. et 3. Dominium non fundatur in gratia aut fide: Christus non abstulit reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na ijs quorum erant, &amp;c. Lordſhippe and principalitie, is not grounded on grace, or belieuing: Chriſt tooke not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Kingdoms, frons them to vvhom they belonged, for hee came not to deſtroy things vvell establiſhed, but to perfect them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, <hi>vvhen a King is made a Christian, which vvas a Pagan, hee loſeth not his earthly Kingdome, which hee had obtayned by right, but acquireth</hi> nouum ius, <hi>a nevv right.</hi> Which <hi>nevv right,</hi> if <hi>Becane</hi> may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued, as an Interpreter, or Concluder, or Iudge; is the <hi>Primacie in the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo we haue him crying guiltie, confeſsing the queſtion: let vs ſound the victory. For if there be no iarre heere betwixt the Ieſuits about this Primacie,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:19639:139"/>then haue wee plainly confirmed, and euicted them, that <hi>Christian Princes haue a Primacie in the Church.</hi> For ſo <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> expreſly and dogmatically, affirmeth, That <hi>Ethnick Kings becomming Christians, acquire a nevv right.</hi> Which <hi>new right,</hi> by confeſsion of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane, is the Primacy in the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore Chriſtian Kings haue a <hi>Primacie in the Church.</hi> But vvhat is the <hi>Primacie</hi> of Pagan Kings, as Pagans, I leaue it to the Papiſts themſelues to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>

               <p>HIs firſt words of the 12.

For, hauing ſet downe the Queſtion thus, <hi>Whence, and by vvhat title, hath the King Primacie in the Church?</hi> hee ſaith; <hi>The meaning of this Question is, Whether the King haue Primacie as a King, or as a Christian King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as <hi>Becane</hi> hath produced Ma. <hi>Thomſon,</hi> &amp; Ma. <hi>Burhill,</hi> in his 1. and 2. Queſtions, They both deny the King to haue Primacie in the Church. Therefore the Ieſuit heer ſets downe the <hi>Suppoſitum</hi> as of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and not as out of their opinions. But what meant the Ieſuit to ſay, hee diſputed heere, when he onely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the Queſtion? Do boyes vſe to diſpute with their Maiſters, when they onely aske queſtions of their Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters? Indeed, if the Ieſuit had diſputed, hee ſhould haue diſputed as in my <hi>Engliſh Concord</hi> is ſet downe; and ſo by his diſpute, he had not taken away his ovvn <hi>Suppoſitum,</hi> (as heere hee doth) but had diſputed out of the opinion of ſome others, who averre the Kings Primacy.</p>
               <p>As touching the Iarre; the <hi>Engliſh Concord,</hi> euen out of the expreſſe words of Ma. <hi>Thomſon,</hi> manifeſted the agreement between the reuerend Biſhop, and Ma. <hi>Thomſon,</hi> in this point, ſo plainly &amp; directly; that Ma. <hi>Thomſon</hi> himſelfe wondred that <hi>Becane</hi> could ſtumble at it, as at any Iarie. And now lately comes forth Ma. <hi>Burhill,</hi> in his Appendix pag. 289. aſſerting, That <hi>an
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:19639:140"/>Ethnick King, vvhiles he is an Ethnicke King, can no more be ſupreme Gouernour of the Church, then an Ethnick man. vvhile he is an Ethnick man, may be a Prieſt, of, or in the Church.</hi> And ſo, touching this poynt, &amp; this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, heere is made up, a full &amp; vniforme Concord: and the Ieſuiticall myſt of this ſuppoſed great Iarre, vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpelled.</p>
               <p>But, is this Ieſuit well in his wits, affirming, <hi>That if the King, preciſely as King, haue Eccleſiaſticall Primacie; then hee is ſecure, becauſe as long as hee is King, he can not loſe it; but if hee haue it as a Christian King, hee may loſe it?</hi> vvhen as death, or, (by their Antichriſtan popiſh new doctrine) the Pope (by one breath of his mouth, at his pleaſure, excommunicating, and thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing any Chriſtian King) may take away his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and ſo his primacie: but neither Pope, death, nor diuel, can take away his Chriſtianitie. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 35.</p>
               <p>Note alſo heere (good Chriſtian Reader) the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible impudencie of this Ieſuit; who ironically affer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, That Kings are ſure, and may be ſecure to enioy their kingdoms; when as <hi>Suarius,</hi> in his ſpanne-new Booke, hath made it knowen to all the world, that by Ieſuiticall doctrine (moſt ſtiffely defended as ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall, and now in force) Kings are not ſure to enioy, for the ſpace of one moneth, weeke, or day, their kingdoms, liberties, or liues, if the Pope be diſpoſed to bereaue any of them thereof. That is, to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate them; and that is very eaſily done, euen by the breath of his mouth, wheaſoeuer he is pleaſed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendany cauſe thereof. For then, by their Canon law, becauſe hee is ſupreme Iudge, whoſe will ſtands for

               </p>
               <p>Thus in plaine truth, by theſe poyſonfull miſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Ieſuits, are the liues and kingdoms of all Kings Chriſtian, brought at this day into farre more immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger, then are the liucs and liuings of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt vaſſals of the ſaid Kings: and yet (ſaith this Ieſuit) <hi>Kings, in reſpect of their kingdoms, may ſleepe ſoundlie on both ſides.</hi> Which indeed is nothing elſe, but to lull them aſleepe in the bedde of careleſſe ſecuritie; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, with more ſpeed and leſſe danger, to cut their throats.</p>

               <p>IAunſwere: firſt, that vvhereas the Ieſuit in diuerſe places of his <hi>Examen,</hi> hath profeſſed, that he vvill diſpute nothing but about the <hi>Engliſh Iarres;</hi> hee hath heere forgotten himſelfe, and endeuoureth the refutation of Ma. <hi>Thomſon,</hi> and Ma. <hi>Burhill,</hi> touching the <hi>Eccleſiasticall Primacy</hi> of Pagan Kings, requiring an aunſwete thereof, either from me, or them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the Ieſuits ignorance in Logicke is ſuch, that he doth not vnderſtand when he reaſoneth, and when hee reaſoneth not.</p>
               <p>In his <hi>Engliſh Iarre,</hi> chap. 12. Sect. 3. his words are theſe; <hi>According to the opinion of</hi> Thomſon, &amp; Burhill, <hi>all Pagan Kings are Primats of the Church: Therefore, all</hi> Engliſhmen <hi>liuing in</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>or</hi> Rome, <hi>are ſubiect to the Turke, or Pope, in matters Eccleſiasticall.

Then ſubiects ſhall make themſelues Iudges of their Kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heere are fiue ſeuerall inferences, all tending to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the abſurdities, wich neceſſarily ſollow vpon the ſuppoſed opinion of Maiſter <hi>Thomſon,</hi> and Ma. <hi>Burhil.</hi> heerein: and yet the Ieſuit ſaith, <hi>hee doth not diſpute.</hi> Moreouer, in expreſſe words hee concludeth thus; <hi>That if the</hi> Engliſh <hi>be ſubiect to the</hi> Tufkiſh <hi>Emperor, as Primate: and the</hi> Turke <hi>commaund them to follovv the</hi> Alcotan; <hi>they must obey his commaund: or othervviſe,

               </p>
               <p>What is this elſe, but to conclude thus; If Pagan Kings be Primats of the Church, then all men liuing in their dominions, are bound to doe what they ſhall impiouſly commaund: vnleſſe the Ieſuit will denie, that the Turks commaund is impious, viz. to <hi>follovv the Alcoran?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And is not this goodly, helliſh, Ieſuiticall doctrine, practiced by the Ieſuits, according to their oath, <hi>Caecae obedientiae,</hi> of blind obedience; to peruert the faith, &amp; fidelity of ſubiects, to God, and their King; to deſtroy Kings and kingdoms: to diſturbe the peace of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, by their combuſtions tumbling of garments in blond, if their ſupreme ludge and Primate ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, that the <hi>Engliſh Concord,</hi> gaue this fondling more ſufficient anſwere then he deſerued, to all theſe his queſtions, by retorting them vpon himſelfe, thus: <hi>The Catholick</hi> (ſo called) <hi>Venetians, and Sorbonists, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knovvledge the Pope to be their Eccleſiaſticall Primate. Then they are ſubiect to him as Primate. Then, if he as Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, commaund them to obey him in temporalls, in order to ſpirituall things, vvhat ſhall they doe? Shall they obey him? Then they ſhall doe against conſcience. Shall they not obey him? Then they ſhall deny his Primacy. Shall they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him vvhen they thinke good? Then the ſubiects ſhall make themſelues Iudges of their ſupreme Iudge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This pinched the Ieſuit to the quicke, anſwering fully his queſtions, if hee had anſwered theſe: but alas, his ſillineſſe could ſhape no ſolid anſwere thereunto.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I anſwere, That ſuppoſing the Turkiſh Emperour to be Primat Eccleſiaſticall in his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;

            <p>YOu ſay, that I confeſſe the Primacy Eccleſiaſticall of Kings Chriſtian, becauſe vvhere <hi>Bellarmine</hi> vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thus: (<hi>Quando Rex, &amp;c.</hi> When a King of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan becomes a Chriſtian, hee doth not loſe the earthlis kingdome, vvhich of right he had before, but he getteth <hi>novum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius,</hi> a nevv right.) I interprete thoſe vvords of <hi>Bellarmine, a new right,</hi> to be Eccleſiaſticall Primacie. I did not interprete the vvords of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> but of the <hi>Chaplaine,</hi> though they ſeeme to be the ſame. For, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> addeth thus: <hi>Acquirit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ius novum ad vitam aeternam: Hee getteth a new right to life aeternall:</hi> vvhich new right, not onely Ethnick Kings, but alſo their ſubiects, obtaine, vvhen of Pagans they become Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. But the <hi>Chaplaine</hi> meaneth, by <hi>new right, Primacie Eccleſiaſticall:</hi> for hee ſaith, that the Chriſtian King, by force of excommunication, loſeth that <hi>new right.</hi> Truely, he cannot loſe the <hi>rightto eternall life</hi> by excommunication, but by his owne fault onely. <hi>Richard,</hi> goe now and triumph.</p>

               <p>THe <hi>Engliſh Concord,</hi> charged this Ieſuit with acknowledgement of the <hi>Eccleſiastical Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> of Chriſtian Kings: becauſe [vvhereas the reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> cited the words of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> as out of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe; and as fully to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> meaning, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe doth, <hi>De Rom Pont. lib. 5. cap.</hi> 2. <hi>et</hi> 3.] the Ieſuit interpreted thoſe ſaid words cited by the Biſhop, of <hi>Primacy Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> which Chriſtian Kings obtaine, when of Pagan, they become Chriſtian Kings. Vnto which, this ſilly diſputant hath nothing elſe to anſwere but this; That hee did not interpret thoſe words, <hi>novum ius, a nevv right,</hi> as the words of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> but as the words of the Biſhop. Which anſwere is very idle, ſeeing that the Biſhop produced them, as the words of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and not as his own.</p>
               <p>The Ieſuit, to back his aunſwere, ſaith; <hi>That Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine addeth for explication of thoſe vvords, a nevv right,</hi> ad vitam aeternam; <hi>to life eternall: vvhich the Biſhoppe leaueth out.</hi> And further, <hi>that the Biſhop ſaith, The</hi> new right <hi>may be loſt by Excommunication; but the right to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life, cannot be loſt by force of excommunication, but onely by the owne fault of him that loſeth it.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>That not onely Kings, but all their priuat ſubiects, may gaine, by their conuerſion, that new right to eternall life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vnto which, I reply: Firſt, that the words cited by the Biſhop, explicat thoſe words, <hi>nevv right,</hi> to bee meant, of a <hi>right to eternall life,</hi> as fully as <hi>Bellarmines</hi> words doe. The very expreſſe words of <hi>Bellarmine,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:19639:143"/>De Ro. Pon. lib. 5. c. 3. colum.</hi> 1077. are theſe; <hi>Quando Rexfit Chriſtianus, non perdit regnum terrenum, quod iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re obtinebat, ſed acquirit nouum ius ad regnum aeternum. When a Pagan King becomes a Chriſtian King, hee loſeth not his earthly kingdome, which by right hee obtained; but hee getteth a new right to the kingdome eternall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Biſhops expreſſe words in <hi>Tort. Tort.</hi> pag. 40. 1.1. are theſe; <hi>Rex quinis, cum de Ethnico Christianus fit, non per dit terrenumius, ſed acquiritius nouum; puta, in bonis Eccleſiae ſpiritualibus. Euery King, vvhen of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, hee becommeth a Chriſtian King, dooth not loſe his earthlie right, to vvit, in the ſpirituall good things of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which words it is moſt apparant, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, no leſſe then <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> explaneth that <hi>nevv right,</hi> to ben <hi>right to eternall life:</hi> vnto which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kings are brought by thoſe ſaid ſpirituall good things of the Church; beeing the meanes which God hath ordained, and ſanctified to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I reply, that as Exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon no fault of the Chriſtian King, cannot take away his right to eternall life, ſo it cannot take away his Primacy Eccleſiaſticall.</p>
               <p>Againe, that Excommunication grounded vpon a grieuous ſinne of the excommunicated, ioyned with impenitencie and obſtinacie; may as well, may rather, cauſe him to loſe <hi>his right to life eternall;</hi> as it may force him to loſe his <hi>Primacy Eccleſiaſticall.</hi> Doth not the perpetuall binding of any mans ſinnes, viz. beeing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and impenitent, exclude him directly from his <hi>right to eternall life;</hi> but that binding, if at all, excludeth him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Primacy,</hi> indirectly, &amp; by conſequent only</p>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:19639:144"/>
               <p>Laſtly, I reply, That although it be true, that priuat ſubiects, as wel as their Kings, becomming Chriſtians, or Pagans, get a <hi>new right to euerlaſting life:</hi> yet that is nothing to the purpoſe, which intendeth Kings one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (not priuat perſons) what they acquire or loſe, in becomming Chriſtian Kings.</p>
               <p>Now, the <hi>new right to the Kingdome eternall,</hi> is, as their new ſeruice of GOD is, to the King eternall. But according to Saint <hi>Auguſtine: Heerein Christian Kings, as Christian Kings, ſerue the Lord; vvhen they do thoſe things to ſerue him, vvhich they could not doe, but as they are, or in that they are Chriſtian Kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not enough for a Chriſtian King, towards the obtaining of eternall life, or, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſpeaketh, of Gods <hi>eternall kingdome,</hi> to ſerue the Lord, as a Chriſtian King, that is, by executing his <hi>Primacy Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> as hee that is <hi>Cuſtos vtriuſque Tabulae, The graund or Cauſe-keeper of both the Tables;</hi> and ſo holding his <hi>nevv right to life eternall.</hi> According to that of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> vnto the ſame ſenſe, though in another caſe: 1. Tim. chap. 2. ver. 15. <hi>Women, through bearing of children ſhall be ſaued, if they continue in faith, and loue, and holineſſe vvith modeſtie:</hi> ſo Chriſtian Kings ſhall be ſaued, by well vſing their <hi>Primacy Eccleſiasticall,</hi> if they continue in faith, loue, and holines.</p>
               <p>Thus are all theſe ſeuerall examinations Ieſuiticall, as Potters ſheards, ſhiuered to nothing: thus haue we this Ieſuit acknowledging the Eccleſiaſticall Primacie of Chriſtian Kings. Why then, vnleſſe the Ieſuit haue ſomwhat to ſay in arreſt of iudgement, ſhold not we, as we haue obtained, ſo openly <hi>proclaime the victory?</hi>

Which doubt of theirs notwithſtanding did not laſt long, but vvas ſoone taken away by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fiſt, and Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> For the Pope forthwith directed two Apoſtolicall Breues to the Catholiques of <hi>England,</hi> and the ſaid Card, vvrote a letter to Ma. <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> then Archprieſt of this affaire. Both Pope and Cardinall dec deny, that the ſaid Oath may be taken with a ſafe conſcience, and their reaſon is this: Becauſe no: man with a ſafe conſcience,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:19639:146"/>can deny the Catholicke faith. But hee now, who ſhould take this Oath propoſed by the King, ſhould deny the Catholicke faith, though not generally, yet in part, ſo farre foorth as belongeth to ſome one article there of: <hi>Ergo,</hi> no man vvith a ſafe conſcience can take this Oath.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This reaſon, beeing very ſound, all good Catholicks ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: but our Adverſaries doe not. I, in fauour and conſolation of the Catholicks, haue determined to adioyne heere vnto two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſons, eſpecially againſt the Oath of Supremacy, which by the Aduerſaries cannot be reiected. The firſt is this: No man is bound in conſcience to ſweare that which is either apparantlie falſe, or at leaſtwiſe doubt full: But, that the King is Primate, &amp; ſupreme head of the Church, and for ſuch to be obeyed, not onely in temporall, but alſo in Eccleſiaſticall matters, is either appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly falſe, or at leaſtwiſe doubt full: <hi>Ergo,</hi> no man is bound in Conſcience to ſweare the ſame. The <hi>Maior</hi> is cuident of it ſelfe, for that it is not lawfull to affirme any thing which is either falſe er doubtfull, and much leſſe to ſweare the ſame. The <hi>Minor</hi> is prooned thus: For that, it is iudged apparantly falſe, aſwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Caluiniſts, as amongst the Catholicks, that the King is Primate &amp; ſupreme head of the Church. But now amongst the Caluiniſts of England, who adhere vnto the King, the ſame is called into doubt. For that ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> affirme, others deny theſe points following: <hi>1.</hi> That the King is Primate of the Church. <hi>2.</hi> That he is ſupreme head of the Church. 3. That he hath Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiasticall Primasy oner the Church. 4. That hee hath power and Iuriſdiction Eccleſiasticall. 5. That the King by his owne proper Autheritie may aſſemble Councelis or Synods, and ſit as chiefe Head or Preſident therein. 6. That hee can confer bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, or Eccleſiaſticall liuings. 7. That he can creats and depoſe Biſhops. 8. That hee is ludge in Controucrſies of faith, &amp;c. So as truly, if theſe and the like points be doubtfull and vncertaine, amongst thoſe who adhere vnto, and fanour the King. ſeeing that ſome deny them, ſome aſſirme them: it followeth neceſſarily, that the Kings vvhole Primacy is an vncertaine thing. What raſhnes then, &amp; impudencie is it, to goe about to binde Catholicks in their Conſciences to ſweare that, which they themſelues doe affirme
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:19639:147"/>ſome of them to be falſe, ſome others to be doubt full?</p>
               <p n="8">8. I vvill explicate more diſtinctly that which I haue ſaid. The Oath of the Kings Primacy, doth containe ſo many parts as there be, or are thought to be Offices and functions of the Kings Primacy. The Offices then either are, or are thought to bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſe, as we haue ſeen before, towit, to aſſemble Synods, to exact and decree Eccleſiaſticall lawes, to confer benefices, to create Biſhops, to determine controuer ſies of faith, and the like. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, diuerſe are the parts of the Oath of the Kings Supremacie. Of theſe parts then, let vs take one of them by it ſelfe, to wit, this: <hi>I A. B. doe ſweare in my conſcience, that I will be faithfull &amp; obedientvnto the King as often, or whenſoeuer he ſhall by his owne proper authority, create Biſhops, whom he will. &amp; againe depoſe from theis office or dignity, whom hee will. &amp;c.</hi> If this part onely of the Kings Offices, ſhoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Would all, trow you, yea they vvho moſt adhere now vnto the King, ſweare this? Let them ſwear that would; M. <hi>Tooker</hi> I am ſure, if hee be a conſtant man would not.

                  </gap>, who otherwiſe acknowledgeth the Kings Primacie (at leaſt in words) would not ſweare there unto; how then ſhould Catholicks be compelled to doe the ſame, who doe in no wiſe acknow ledge it? And what I haue ſaid concerning this point, the ſame may be alſo ſaid of thereſt.</p>
               <p n="9">9. My other reaſon is this. King <hi>Iames</hi> doth often proteſt, that he claimeth no more right or: Inriſdiction oner the Church, then did the Kings in the olà Tiſtament in ancient times: and therfore that this his Primacy muſt be coutained within the ſame lymits, &amp; termes, that theirs was in the old Teſtament. But the Kings in the old Teſtament could not compell their ſubiects to ſweare ſuch an Oath as this: <hi>I A. B. doe openly teſtifie, and in my conſcience declare, that</hi> Ieroboam <hi>is the onely ſupreme Gonernour of this Kingdome of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as well in ſpirituall as temporall matters: And that no forrayner hath any iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, power, ſuperiority, preheminence, or authority in this Kingdom, &amp;c. Ergo,</hi> neither King <hi>Iames</hi> can inforce his
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:19639:147"/>ſubiects to take ſuch a like Oath. The <hi>Maior</hi> is manifeſt out of his Maieſties owne words in his Apologie. The <hi>Minor</hi> I thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate. After the death of King <hi>Salomon,</hi> his kingdome (God ſo diſpoſing) was diuided into two parts: vvhereof one contained ten Tribes: the other two. So as by this meanes, they became two diſtinct kingdoms afterwards, and therein raigned two diſtinct Kings, one whereof had no depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance of the other in temporall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nernment. One was called King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the other, King of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da:</hi> and both of them had ſucceſſors in their kingdoms. The first Kings that ruled, after the diniſion of the kingdome made, were <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> &amp; <hi>Roboam</hi> King of <hi>Iuda.</hi> In either Kingdom were Prieſts and Leuits. But the high or Chiefe Prieſt, could not reſid-in both kingdoms, but onely in one, and that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily in <hi>Iuda:</hi> yet not withſtanding, hee was Head of all the Pruſts and Leuites that remained in both Kindoms. Neither could <hi>Ieroboam</hi> lawfully ſay vnto his Prieſts and Leuites: <hi>You ſhall not obey the High Prieſt, that reſideth in the Kingdom of</hi> Iuda: <hi>but you ſhall obey me onely: for you are exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from his iuriſdiction and power, &amp;c.</hi> And though he ſhold haue ſo ſaid; yet no doubt but he had offended.

That with more certaine and aſſured tokens, you may eſpy the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate malice of theſe raylers (as the Pope</hi> Paul 5, <hi>Cardinall</hi> Bellarmine, <hi>and</hi> Becane) <hi>who impudently affirme, that this Oath was deuiſed to entrap, and beguile, the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of improuident Papists, in matters of faith; I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the vvhole paſſage of the matter in few vvords. As ſoone as this for me of the Oath of Allegiance vvas conceined, the lower houſe of Parliament, thought good to inſert that clauſe, vvhereby all power ſhould bee taken from the Pope to excommunicate the King. But I preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſed the ſame to be razed out; to the end, that it might appeare, that this Oath had no other force or reſpect, then that the Popes excommunication, ſhould be no iust or law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cauſe vnto my ſubiects, by ſecret or open practiſes, to attempt any thing against my perſon, or my kingdome; becauſe I thought that this ſentence of excommunication, of a ſpirituall cenſure, was by vniuſt vſurpation of Popes, made a ſecular pretence, and ſo exorbitant beyond all bounds. With ſo great care and ſtudie I did auoide, that nothing ſhould be contained in this Oath, but that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſion of ciuill allegiance, and temp or all obedience, vvhich
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:19639:151"/>nature it ſelfe preſcribeth to all them, vvhich are borne vnder any kingdom, adding onely a firme promiſe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I demaund of my ſubiects, ayde, and aſsistance againſt the breach of due allegiance, and fidelitie. Wherefore, I faw it appertained to the cauſe, that I ſhould make an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie for this Oath: vvherein I haue taken vpon mee to proue, that nothing is contained heerein, but that vvhich concerneth meere ciuill and temporall obedience, ſuch as is due to all ſoueraigne Princes.</hi>

               <p>Concerning your glorious Martyrs (as you ſtile Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe <hi>Fiſher,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi>) you might haue learned out of <hi>Tortura Torti,</hi> pag. 360. how the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> ſtoppeth <hi>Tortus</hi> his mouth, ſaying: <hi>Dixerat Apologiae author, &amp;c. The Author of the Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie ſaid, that it was not any ſpirituall Primacy, but a carnall matrimony, that brought the ſuppoſed Martyr dome to Sir</hi> Thomas More, <hi>and the Biſhop of</hi> Rocheſter: <hi>and this he ſpake not amiſſe. But then replyed</hi> Tortus: <hi>Then it vvas a carnall matrimany, that cauſed holy S.</hi> Iohn Baptiſt <hi>to ſuffer martyrdome, when he freely reproued King</hi> Herods <hi>mariage. With this example</hi> Tortus <hi>woundeth himſelfe. For tell mee, O</hi> Tortus, <hi>vvhat was that mariage? vvas it not with his brothers wife? vvas not this the vvord that: coſt the</hi> Baptiſt <hi>his life?</hi> It is not lawful for thee to haue
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:19639:151"/>thy brothers wife. <hi>But what was the cauſe of the death of</hi> More, <hi>and</hi> Fiſher? <hi>was it not cleane contrary?</hi> It is lawful for thee, to haue thy brothers wife; it is not lawful for thee to put her away. <hi>So that if Saint</hi> Iohn, <hi>Christs fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner, died vniustly, they died moſt iustly: and if hee vvere a Martyr, (as he was) then vvere they ſome other thing: vvhich I will not tell you. For he dyed, that the King ſhould not keepe his brothers vvife: but theſe dyed, that the King ſhould not put away his brothers vvife. Hee told King</hi> Herod, <hi>it vvas not lawfull: they told King</hi> Henry, <hi>it was lawfull, and hee must not doe otherwiſe. Could</hi> Tortus <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vvaies marre their martyr dome more deepely?</hi> So far the Biſhop of <hi>Ely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And giue mee leaue to adde ſomething more. O glorious Martyrs! who had rather conſent together to die, then to confeſſe the royall <hi>ſupremacy</hi> of Kings, eſtabliſhed in the Scriptures, vſed and practiſed by all the moſt commended Chriſtian Kings; and withall; to eſtabliſh the <hi>Papall Primacy,</hi> which Chriſt himſelfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly forbad: which the Fathers of the Councell of <hi>Epheſus</hi> called the <hi>ſmoake of worldly power;</hi> and they of <hi>Carthage,</hi> with all care, and diligence, admoniſhed the Church to beware of, as <hi>Typhum ſaeculi, the arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of this preſent vvorld.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning that notorious fact of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fift, and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> (which heere the Ieſuit remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth) full of inhumanitie, impietie, and audaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; that excellently learned man, Ma. <hi>Cauſabon,</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Front Ducaeus,</hi> hath taught him, pag. 167. thus: <hi>De fidelitatis iuramento, cui occaſionem praebuit pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraria coniuratio, &amp;c. Concerning that Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, first occaſioned by the Gun-powder treaſon, I maruell
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:19639:152"/>vvhy the Engliſh Papiſts ſo much complaine. They haue much more cauſe to complaine of Cardinall</hi> Bellarmine, <hi>&amp; ſome fevv others, vvho hardened the hart of Pope</hi> Paul <hi>the fift to yeeld vnto them, (vvho at the first vvith stood them: for I ſpeake not raſhly, but haue good Authours for my aſſurance) that all the Catholicks in England ſhould heere periſh, rather then a matter ſo iuſt and equall ſhould be permitted. For, vvhat can be more equall, then that ſubiects ſhould promiſe fidelity to their Soueraigne? eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally after a treaſon ſo barbarous, and notable, for crueltie? The King in the Common-wealth, is the ſame that a houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder is in his priuate houſe: and doe you thinke that ſuch a man were well adviſed, to keepe in his family any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts, of whoſe fidelity he was not perſwaded? or rather, whoſe diſpoſution hee greatly ſuſpecteth? I thinke no bodie, that is not mad, would grant ſuch a thing. Wherfore, either King</hi> Iames <hi>hath leſſe power in his Kingdome, then a houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder in his houſe, or elſe theſe complaints about the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects Oath of Allegiance, are all vniust, and friuolous. For in good ſooth, I haue met with many Papists, both in France and England, and I haue alſo read the writings of many, vvho deeme this Oath not onely moſt iust, but alſo moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. Wherefore, many of your ſide, &amp; ſome of them Prieſts, yea, the Arch-prieſt</hi> Black well, <hi>haue taken the ſame with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ſcruple of conſcience, not againſt their wills: and by their publique writings, learnedly and truly (though ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the Pope and the Ieſuits) haue perſwaded others to doe the like; (ſuch are Maister</hi> Sheldon, <hi>and Maiſter</hi> Warmington.) <hi>But yet there are ſome, vvith whom the Popes Bulls, and</hi> Bellarmines <hi>Letters, preuaile more then the law of God, the law of nature, &amp; of all Nations, or the examples of vviſe men. And if the Law run vpon theſe,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:19639:152"/>vvhat place is there left for complaint? And you your ſelues, which call this a perſecution of</hi> Catholicks, <hi>cannot tell, for vvhat cauſe, and by vvhat example of antiquitie, you ſo tearme it. It was neuer done, nor heard of, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian people ſaid they ſuffered perſecution, if they vvere commaunded to ſweare Allegiance to their Soueraigne. But wee read the contrary in the Councells; vvhere they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed that breake faith to their Kings, vvhich they had voxed to them, for the preſeruation of the ſlate of their Countrey, and of their King. And you know, the fourth Councell of</hi> Toledo, <hi>declareth all ſuch exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municat from the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heere is worke for the Ieſuit, let him ſatisfie theſe things: and in the meane time let him vnderſtand, that that Catholique faith is accurſed with all <hi>maledictions,</hi> as inhumane, impious, ſacrilegious, Antichriſtian, &amp; diabolicall: whereof this is one Article: <hi>That Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an people ought not to ſweare allegiance to their lawfull So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne:</hi> to weet, that, which, as hath been declared, the law of God, the law of nature, and the Canons of Councells haue ordained, as moſt equall, and moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Orelſe thus, (to ſpeake after <hi>Becans</hi> manner) <hi>That, for Christian people to ſweare allegiance to their lavvfull Prince, is to deny the Catholick faith. And this reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very ſound, all good Catholicks admit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Becane:</hi> but in truth, this reaſon, as very rotten, is onely admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Antichriſtian Catholicks: but we Proteſtants, the onely true, and proper orthodoxall, or right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing Catholicks, will neuer admit it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And I</hi> (ſaith the Ieſuit) <hi>will adioyne two other reaſons, on the behalfe of Catholicks, againſt the Oath of Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, which by the Aduerſary cannot bee reiected.</hi> Hee
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:19639:153"/>ſhould rather haue ſaid thus; <hi>And I, for the deſtruction of my friends, the Romiſh Catholicks, will adioyne two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſons, vvhich may be moſt iuſtly refuſed, &amp; explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by all our Aduerſaries, the Protestants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But hath <hi>Martin</hi> the Ieſuit heere forgotten him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe? were not the reaſons of Pope <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> lately alledged, expreſly brought againſt the oath of Allegiance, which onely was in controuerſie; and will he now diſpute againſt the oath of Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, which is diſtinct and ſeuerall from the Oath in queſtion? <hi>Martin</hi> therefore ſhould rather ſay thus; <hi>I haue determined for the ruine of Catholicks in England, to adioyne two reaſons more, nothing differing from the former.</hi> Well then, let vs heare theſe two prettie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: his firſt reaſon is this;</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is manifeſtly falſe, or at leaſt doubtfull, that the King is Primate, or ſupreme Head of the Church, who muſt be obeyed both in all temporall and Eccleſiaſticall matters, as hee that hath</hi> 1. <hi>an Eccleſiasticall Primacy.</hi> 2. <hi>an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Iuriſ diction: firſt, to call Councells by his ovvne authoritie: and ſecondly to create, and depoſe Biſhops, (for euery meane perſon may conferre a benefice, and no mortall man may be ſupreme Iudge in controuerſies of faith:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe two laſt rehearſed, are no branches of <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiasticall Supremacy). Therefore</hi> (concludeth the Ieſuit) <hi>this Oath muſt not be taken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer: The Antecedent of this reaſon is moſt falſe: For all Proteſtants in England, acknowledge it to be certainly true, &amp; none doubteth thereof: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the King of <hi>England,</hi> is the onely <hi>ſupreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nernor,</hi> or (as the Papiſts expound it) <hi>Primate</hi> and <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Head</hi> of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> vvhom wee
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:19639:153"/>muſt obey in all cauſes, both Eccleſiaſticall and ciuill; as him, that hath the gouernment ouer all Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call perſons, and in all ſpirituall cauſes: or (as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it) which hath the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Primacy,</hi> or <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction Eccleſiaſticall;</hi> and therefore hath power to <hi>call Councells,</hi> and to <hi>create and depoſe Biſhops.</hi> All our men, with one conſent, thinke, ſpeake, and ſwear this. And ſo the Ieſuits firſt reaſon, with ſmall adoe, and no labour, is put to flight.</p>
               <p>But yet the Ieſuit vrgeth the matter more articulate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſaying; <hi>That the oath of the Kings ſupremacie, hath ſo many parts in it, as are thought to be diſtinct offices of the Kings ſupremacy:</hi> and thereupon, culleth out one of them, which hee deemeth moſt abſurd, writing thus: <hi>I A. B. doe ſweare in my conſcience, that I will be faithfull and obedient vnto the King, as often, or vvhenſoeuer hee ſhall by his owne proper authority, create Biſhops, whom hee will, and againe depoſe from their of fice, vvhom hee will, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whom he vvill?</hi> Nay, that is the proper ſpeech of popiſh Antichriſts, <hi>Stat proratione voluntas:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Extrauag. de tranſ. Epiſc. quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</note> 
                  <hi>My will ſtandeth for a law.</hi> But Chriſtian Princes ſay thus; <hi>Idpoſsumus quodiure poſsumus: Wee can doe nothing but that which we can doe by law and right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, any Chriſtian ſubiect, and by name D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Tooker,</hi> may ſweare in this manner: <hi>I A. B. doe ſweare in my conſcience, that I will be faithfull and obedient to the King, as often, or whenſoeuer he ſhall by his own proper au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, depoſe Biſhops for iuſt cauſes, as</hi> Salomon <hi>did</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biathar.</p>
               <p>But let <hi>Martin Becane</hi> put on the thoughts of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and ſober man awhile, and tell me, Whether the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:19639:154"/>oath of Supremacy containe ſo many parts, as are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be the offices or functions of the Primacie? He ſaith, <hi>putantur,</hi> as are <hi>thought,</hi> or ſuppoſed; vvhat of any triobular or meane Writer of the Engliſh, or Romane partie? Fie, fie, who can abide this? Nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the oath of the Kings Supremacy, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no more, then thoſe offices of the royall <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi> which is manifeſt that the Kings of Iſrael in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture executed with commendation: and ſo doth the Kings Maieſtie write, in the ſame expreſſe tearmes. All which offices are articularly, and exactly ſet downe by him in his Apology, pag. 127. 128. And by the Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> in his <hi>Tortura Tort.</hi> pa. 377. 378. collected out of, &amp; confirmed by the vvord of God.</p>
               <p>But heere I would deſire the Ieſuit to tell me, vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the oath of the Popes Supremacy containe as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts, as are the offices and functions of the ſaid Supremacie, <hi>thought to be,</hi> by the Ieſuits, Canoniſts, Popes Paraſits, &amp; Popes themſelues?

               </p>
               <p>If this part onely of the Popes Supremacy, ſhould be exacted of all the Ieſuits, what, doe you thinke, would bee done? Would all, thinke you, yea they which adhere vnto the Pope, ſweare this? Let them ſweare that would, as <hi>Baronius, Triumphus, Carerius,</hi> and almoſt all the Canoniſts, and many other famous Popiſh Writers. Yet, I amſure, that <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and <hi>Becane,</hi> if they be conſtant men, will neuer ſweare. For thus writeth <hi>Bellarmine, Papa not habet vllam merè tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralem iuriſdictionem directè iure diuino, lib. de Pont. Rom. 5. cap. 4. The Pope hath no meere temporall iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction directly by the law of God.</hi> And <hi>Becane</hi> in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furation, pag. 18. <hi>Acprimum non diſceptamus de pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matu in temporalibus, illum quiſque Rex inſuo regno le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimè habeat: Wee diſpute not of the Primacy in temporall cauſes, let euery King in his kingdome, lawfully poſſeſſe the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What then? Is this ſo ſure a ground with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Becane,</hi> that they firmely determine to loſe their liues, like many glorious Martyrs in this kingdome, rather then to admit the Popes ſupremacie, &amp; abiure the Kings? For this is thought to be one of the prime offices of the Popes <hi>ſupremacy, That the Pope is Lord of
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:19639:156"/>the whole world, directly in all temporall cauſes.</hi> But, this is vtterly falſe in the conſcience of <hi>Becane</hi> and <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi> Or whether, partly, <hi>for preſeruation of externall peace and gouernment, which theſe meneſteeme more then their faith and religion:</hi> or, partly, that one of them may be made Pope, the other a Cardinall, which good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune may befall them heereafter; will they ſweare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their owne conſcience vnto the Popes ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, with all functions which are <hi>thought</hi> to be parts thereof, and thereof ſhall be branded as <hi>Carerius</hi> hath marked them, to be <hi>impious Polititians of our time, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing rather the name of Hareticks, then of Catholicks?</hi> Of whom may Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fiſt truly affirme, That he hath found more truth in <hi>ſauage &amp; wilderobbers,</hi> then in theſe kinde of men, (viz. the Ieſuits) which teach &amp; practice the Art of Equiuocation, euen in their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne ſwearing. And thus much for the firſt reaſon: which I am ſure is enough, (if not too much) for <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> and <hi>Becane</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>His ſecond reaſon is this: <hi>King</hi> Iames <hi>dooth often protest, that he claimeth no more right or iuriſdiction ouer the Church, then did the Kings in the old Testament long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe.</hi> But the Kings in the old Teſtament, could not compell their ſubiects to ſweare ſuch an oath as this is; <hi>I A. B. doe openly testifie, and in my conſcience declare, that <hi>Ieroboam</hi> is the onely ſupreme Gouernor of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Iſrael, as well in ſpirituall, as temporall matters: And that no forrainer hath, or ought to haue any iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, power, ſuperiority, or authority in this kingdom.</hi> Ergo, <hi>King Iames, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, a little after, hee explicateth his <hi>Minor</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition thus: <hi>After King</hi> Salomon, <hi>there vvere two
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:19639:156"/>diſtinct kingdoms,</hi> Iuda <hi>and</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and there vvere two Kings, vvhereof both had their ſucceſſors. There vvere Prieſts and Leuites in both, who vvere chiefely ruled by the high Prieſt, who liued in</hi> Ieruſalem. <hi>And yet</hi> Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam <hi>could not lawfully ſay to his Prieſts and Leuites, you ſhall not obey that High Prieſt reſident in</hi> Iuda: <hi>you are exempt from his iuriſdiction, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Becane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer: Can any man endure, either in a Diuine ſo great ignorance, or ſuch malice in a Ieſuit? As though the Kings Maieſtie did euer belieue, write, or ſo much as dreame, either, that all thoſe things which the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (of whom <hi>Ieroboam</hi> was ring-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) did practice impiouſly in Eccleſiaſticall matters: or that, all that iuriſdiction which thoſe vngodly kings did challenge ouer the Church, doth belong to the King <hi>ſupremacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> thus ſpeaketh holy writ, 1. Kings, 12.28. <q>
                     <hi>The King made two golden Calues, and ſaid vnto the Iſraelites, It is too much for you to goe vp to Ieruſalem: Behold the Gods that brought you vp out of the Land of</hi> Egypt. <hi>And hee put one of them in</hi> Bethel, <hi>and the other in</hi> Dan. <hi>Alſo, hee made a houſe of the high places, and made bim Priests of the loweſt of the people, vvho were not of the ſonnes of</hi> Leui. <hi>And</hi> Ieroboam <hi>made a feast, in the fifteenth day of the eight Moneth, like vnto the feast that is in</hi> Iudah, <hi>and ſacrificed on the Altar. So did hee in</hi> Bethel, <hi>and offered vnto the Calues that hee had made. And hee constituted in</hi> Bethel, <hi>the Priests of the high places which hee had made.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And you may read in the 13. chapter, <q>
                     <hi>That beeing rebuked by a Prophet for this matter, yet hee departed not from his euill way, but turned himſelfe, and made him
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:19639:157"/>Priests of the high places,</hi> de ſaece populi, <hi>of the dregs of the people; and vvhoſoeuer pleaſed him, hee conſecrated him, and made him a Priest of the high places.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And againe, 2. Chron. II. chap. 13. verſe, <q>
                     <hi>And the Prieſts and the Leuites that vvere in all Iſrael, reſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him out of all their coaſts, (meaning</hi> Roboam, <hi>the ſonne of</hi> Salomon.) <hi>For the Leuites left their ſuburbs, &amp; their poſſeſsions; and came to</hi> Iudah, <hi>and to</hi> Ieruſalem: <hi>for</hi> Ieroboam <hi>and his ſonnes had cast them out from mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring in the Priests office before the Lord.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But thus writeth the King, and his learned Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretour, the Biſhoppe of <hi>Ely,</hi> in <hi>Tort. Tort.</hi> pag. 381. <hi>Quodcunque in rebus religionis reges Iſrael fecerunt, nec ſine laude fecerunt, id vt et Regi</hi> Iacobo, <hi>faciendi ius ſit atque potestas. Whatſoeuer the Kings of Iſrael did vvith commendation, in the maters of Religion; the ſame power and iuriſdiction now hath King</hi> Iames.</p>
               <p>Let this therefore be the Propoſition, or firſt part of the ſecond reaſon, which <hi>Becane</hi> himſelfe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth in his Refuration, cap. 8. pag. 124: and then I will aſſume the <hi>Minor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not without <hi>commendation,</hi> by their royall authoritie, in matters of Religion, 1. <hi>Haue enacted lawes.</hi> 2. <hi>Delegated of their ſubiects to iudge of ſuch lawes.</hi> 3. <hi>Haue bound all their ſubiects, both Clergie men, and Lay-men, by oath of Allegiance.</hi> 4. <hi>Haue pumſhed the tranſgreſſors of ſuch lawes.</hi> 5. <hi>Haue called aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies or Councells.</hi> 6. <hi>Haue ruled all eſtates; as the Heads of the Tribe of</hi> Leui, <hi>as vvell as of the other Tribes: and vvere as much Kings of the Clergie, as of the Laitie. 7.</hi> If <hi>any</hi> Abiathar, <hi>or High Prieſt, vvexed proud, they bridled him by their cenſure; and, if there were cauſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed</hi>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:19639:157"/>Abiathar <hi>from the High Priesthood.</hi> 8. <hi>They aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed all ſtrange worſhip: as, when they razed the high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, brake in peeces the golden Calues, and the braſen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, &amp;c. To conclude, they gaue order for things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, which appertained to the outward ſplendour, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of the houſe of G O D: And by their authoritie cut off idle and curious queſtions in religion, vvhich were wont to be the mother and breeder of ſchiſmes:</hi> as the Scriptures expreſly witneſſe; whereof you may read in <hi>Tort. Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi> pag. 381.382.</p>
               <p>Therefore I will conclude, that King <hi>Iames</hi> hath the ſame power, and iuriſdiction; and therfore may binde his ſubiects by an oath: <hi>I A. B. doe openly teſtifie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in my conſcience, that King</hi> Iames <hi>is the oneli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You are all exempt from his power and iuriſdiction.</hi> For ſo Dauid, Salomon, Aſa, Ezekias, and Ioſias, might lawfully commaund their Prieſts &amp; Leuits: and therefore ſo may King <hi>Iames</hi> commaund his Clergie.</p>
               <p>Theſe things (thou maieſt perceiue learned Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) are collected out of the pure fountaines of ſacred Scriptures, and ſo conclude our cauſe ſolidly, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all exception.

               </p>
               <p>According alſo with the decrce of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> cap. 28: or, as it is related by <hi>Carranza,</hi> Seſs. 16. <hi>Sedi veter is Romae patres merito dederunt Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum, quódilla ciuitas caeter is imperaret.</hi> And cap. 12. <hi>Quaſcunque ciuitates per literas regis Metropolitico ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor arunt nomine.

                     </gap>der the old Testament contained theirs;</hi> Then it followeth, that the Primacie of Kings is both godly and certaine, founded on holy Scriptures, and not doubtfull, or falſe, (as this falſary <hi>Martin</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) nor containeth ſo many parts, as are thought to be the offices thereof, by <hi>Hainric, Thomſon, Burhil,</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Tooker,</hi> or any other Proteſtant. Secondly, that King <hi>Iames</hi> may <hi>lawfully, and by right, compell his ſubiects to the Oath of Supremacie.</hi> Thirdly, that Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fiſt, <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> and <hi>Becane,</hi> reſiſted King <hi>Iames</hi> impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and againſt all humanitie, by ſeeking to avert his ſubiects from their allegiance, &amp; from taking both the one, and the other, ſo iuſt and godly an oath; Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner, as <hi>Elymas did reſist the Apostles, ſeeking to turn away the Proconſul fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faith.

               <head>The Concluſion.</head>
               <p>ALl then that hath been hitherto ſaid, may be reduced vnto three heads; The firſt is, that the Kings Supremacy in the Church, is an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent right, &amp; no new thing, but firſt ordained by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>ancient of dayes,</hi> and was practiced in the old time by the moſt approued and pious Kings in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament: But the Popes Supremacie was neuer vſed, by any ſound and godly Biſhop of Rome, before that infamous Emperour <hi>Phocas:</hi> &amp; thefore a new thing, neuer rightly claimed.</p>
               <p>The other, that there be ſo many <hi>iarres,</hi> and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements among the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergie about this <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie</hi> of the <hi>Pope;</hi> that it is not manifeſt, or certaine, what the ſaid <hi>Primacy</hi> is, nor what force, or authoritie the ſame hath.</p>
               <p>The third, that the oath of this Primacy, can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be exacted by the Pope, nor may any Papiſt take the ſame: but the oath of the Kings ſupremacy, may be exacted by the King, and obſerued of all his good ſubiects.</p>
               <p>Heerehence, three other queſtions, which might be made concerning the ſubiects, will eaſily be anſwered. There are three ſorts of ſubiects which liue in thoſe regions where the <hi>Papacy</hi> beareth ſway: 1. The firſt, are <hi>Baronians;</hi> who, in truth acknowledge and ſwear to the <hi>Popes ſupremacy;</hi> that is, to his <hi>direct ſupremacy:</hi> for his indirect ſupremacy is directly ridiculous.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond, <hi>Bellarminians,</hi> or <hi>Pope-puritans,</hi> who doe not acknowledge this ſupremacy, and yet ſweare
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:19639:160"/>vnto it. 3. The third, are true belieuing Proteſtants, who neither acknowledge it, nor will ſweare it.</p>
               <p>The firſt queſtion then is, What may be ſaid of theſe <hi>Baronians?</hi> I anſwere, that they doe vnwiſely, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſideratly; The reaſon is, becauſe it is folly &amp; raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ſweare a thing that is doubtfull &amp; vncertaine: as for example, The Popes ſupremacie; as is manifeſt by their <hi>iarres</hi> and diſſenſions which heeretofore wee haue ſhewed.</p>
               <p>The ſecond queſtion is, What may be ſaid of the <hi>Bellarminians,</hi> or <hi>Pope-puritans?</hi> I anſwere, They are periured perſons, and polititians. The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they belieue one thing, and ſweare another. For they agree and conſent therein, with the right and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxall Proteſtant; and yet with the <hi>Baronians,</hi> they ſweare allegiance to the Pope, as to the Lord Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of the whole world in temporall things, (for Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fift doth challenge the ſame). And this they doe, to keepe an externall and politicall peace, which is more eſteemed by them, then their faith and religion; and therefore are branded by <hi>Carerius,</hi> in his publique writings, and authorized to bee <hi>impious Polititians,</hi> and <hi>haeretiques of this time,</hi> and not <hi>to be called Chriſtians:</hi> And of whom Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fift may truly aſſirme, <hi>That he had found more truth and honeſty in the high-land and bordering thieues, then in this ſort of aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocating people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third queſtion is, What ſhal we ſay of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> who are the right and true Catholicks? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, They be iuſtand vpright men, who walke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in truth and veritie. They be ſincere, vvho profeſſe with their mouth, that which they belieue in
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:19639:161"/>their hart. They are truly couragious, who with good <hi>Eleazarus,</hi> had rather die, then conſent to any vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing, no not ſo much as in outward ſhew. They be like vnto the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who endeuour to <hi>obey God, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then men.</hi> They be like to the Martyrs of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, who freely profeſſe themſelues, before their Perſecutors, to be ſuch as indeed they are: That is to ſay, much vnlike the Ieſuites, who range vp and downe, ſometimes like poore Lay-men, &amp; ſometimes in the habite of Gentlemen, thruſting themſelues into ſolemne aſſemblies at banquets and feaſting; &amp; ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into the Vniuerſities: for ſome of this ſtampe lie cloſe in the Vniuerſities, to peruert inconſtant heads, greedy of nouelties.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, They are miſerable: for, if they refuſe the oath, which Apoc. 13.17. is <hi>the mark of the Beast;</hi> they are forced to vndergoe not onely impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonments, torments, and puniſhments, but alſo death itſelfe. Truly they are not therefore miſerable, but moſt happy; for ſo hath our Sauiour taught vs in the Goſpel, Mat. 5.10. <hi>Bleſſed are they vvho ſuffer perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for righteouſneſſe, for theirs is the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then you will ſay, It is a hard thing to ſuffer: how is that hard which is done with ioy and delight? Heare what is ſaid of the Apoſtles, Acts 5.41. <hi>And they vvent away reioycing from the Councell, becauſe they were counted worthy to ſuffer rebuke for the Name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> Heare alſo what the Apoſtle ſaith of himſelfe, 2. Cor. 7.4. <hi>I am filled vvith comfort, and am exceeding ioyous in all our tribulation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From whence commeth this ioy? but of the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:19639:161"/>gift of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi> Hope of future glory, that maketh vs ioyfull, and full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in all aduerſity, Rom. 8.18. <hi>The afflictions of this preſent time are not vvoorthy of the glory vvhich ſhall bee ſhewed vnto vs.</hi> But the Papiſts ſay thus; <hi>The ſufferings of this life, are worthy of the glory that ſhal be reuealed.</hi> Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Martyrs (as they ſay) their ſufferings are <hi>meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius,</hi> and vnto other <hi>ſupererogatorie:</hi> according to the old verſes of prayer made vnto <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Tuper <hi>Thomae</hi> ſanguinem, quem prote impendit,</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And vnto the Heb. cap. 10.34. <hi>You ſuffered vvith ioy the ſpoyling of your goods, knowing that you ſhall haue a better, and more enduring ſubſtance.</hi> But of the Ieſuits, it may bee ſaid cleane contrary; You haue receiued plenty of other mens goods, to their vnrecouerable harme, (witneſſe the Venetians) knowing, that heere you receiue your reward in this world, and therefore cannot looke for any better, or more <hi>enduring ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> in the world to come.</p>
               <p>And no leſſe is the force and power of <hi>Charity,</hi> Rom. 8.35. <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate vs from the loue of Chriſt? Shall tribulation? or anguiſh? or famine, &amp;c. But in all theſe things we are more then conquerours, through him that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vs. I am perſwaded that neither death, nor life, nor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, &amp;c. nor any creature ſhall be able to ſeparate vs from the loue of God, which is in Chriſt our Lord.</hi> But the Ieſuits call this pious and godly <hi>aſſurance, impious preſumption.</hi>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:19639:162"/>And from this forge came that flagitious diſcourſe of <hi>Bellarmine, De incertitudine iuſtitiae; Of the vncertaintie of righteouſnes or iuſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heereto belong the examples of Chriſt, &amp; of other the Saints, which haue great force and efficacie to ſtir vp and ſtrengthen the harts of Catholiques, to ſuffer patiently in this life, priſons, fetters, torments, yea, death it ſelfe. 1. Pet. 2.20. <hi>If you ſuffer patiently for well dooing, this is thanke-worthy with God. Heereunto are ye called, becauſe that Chriſt hath ſuffered for you, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning you an example, that you ſhould follow his footſteppes, who did not ſin, neither was there guile found in his mouth: who, when he was reuiled, reuiled not againe: when he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, he threatned not; but committed it to him, that iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth righteouſly.</hi> But of the Ieſuits it may be ſaid cleane contrarily, and moſt truly: They doing euill continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuffer impatiently; whoſe glory is their ſhame (wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the <hi>Venetian.</hi>) For heerevnto are they called: to make of faithfull ſubiects, rebells and Traytors to their Kings: to ſley or poyſon Kings (thereby trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the manifold, and deeply imprinted, ſteps of of Antichriſt): to commit all moſt hainous and blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy acts, to their vttermoſt endeuour.
